# The use of adjectives in adventure novels VS biographies.

Twan Huiskens (S4781619)


## General Information

I am studying the use of adjectives in adventure novels and biographies because I want to find
out how the use of adjectives is different between these two genres in order to help my reader
understand the difference in language between the genres. This research might in the future help to better understand 
the difference in language between adventure novels and biographies but also novels and biographies in general.


## Background Information

There is not research done on the difference in use of adjectives between (adventure) novels and biographies. However
some research is done on adjectives in novels. Two well known novels have been analysed to see how much adjectives are used.

Nuhiu (2021) looked at the use of adjectives in the novel 'The Great Gatsby'. There are in total 2701 adjectives used in 'The Great Gatsby' (Nuhiu, 2021). 

Salim (2016) investigated how adjectives were used in the Harry Potter book 'The Deathly Hallows', and more specifically how they where used to portray the protagonists.

Since there is no research like this done for biographies it's hard to compare the two based on literature alone, that's where my research might fill in a gap.


## Research Question & Hypothesis

**Research question:** Is there a difference between adjective use in adventure novels and biographies?

**Hypothesis:** Adjectives are descriptive. This is more important in novels then in biographies, therefor I expect there to be more adjectives in novels.

## Method

For this project I will use adventure novels and biographies from the project Gutenberg. 

I will make sure that the novels and biographies are sourced from the same time periods. This is to ensure that differences in the use of adjectives
are not due to the fact that language changes throughout time.

Next to controlling the time of publishing I will also make sure that size of the adventure novel corpus and the size
of the biography corpus are about the same size so the size of the corpus will not affect the frequency of the adjectives.

To find the adjectives I will use part-of-speech (POS) tagger. There are a quite some (good) options available as python libraries. I will include the model used to
find the POS-tags with the code, and the found adjectives and in which book they where found in this repository.
