INTRODUCTION


The history of Linn county is covered by the events of only a few
years, if compared with the history of communities east of the
Mississippi. The space of one life-time embraces all that has happened
here since the first white man looked upon our goodly heritage. True,
that life has been prolonged beyond the scriptural three score and ten
years. Robert Ellis, who came to this community more than seventy years
ago, and who was one of the very early settlers, yet lives in a hale
and vigorous age on land he "claimed" at that time.

But if the history of the county does not cover many years, it yet is a
history crowded with happenings of interest, some of the incidents
being more or less stirring.

History is defined as a record of the past. It does not concern itself
with the present. It has been the purpose of the editors of this volume
to treat somewhat at length of the early days in the county. Those
conversant with events occurring prior to the Civil war are rapidly
moving on, and it is high time that their recollections of beginnings
here were gathered and put in permanent form.

This has been attempted--how imperfectly done no one realizes more
keenly than we realize it. But like little Mary Wood of the story, we
have done the best we could in the few months given us to prepare the
pages which follow. We have done some things which need not be done
again by any one who follows us. We have made definite some things in
our history as a county that heretofore have been matters of
uncertainty. It is felt that the present volume will make an excellent
starting point for some future chronicler.

The task of the historian has been an arduous one--far more arduous
than can be imagined by any save those who have done similar work.
Withal the task has been one of pleasure and of inspiration. The
pursuit of knowledge in this instance has really been a delight.

We have been taught many things by our work that add to the sum of the
pleasures of living in a day crowded with all the conveniences of the
twentieth century. Our respect for the courageous pioneer men and the
equally courageous and self-sacrificing pioneer women of our county has
been placed high. Nobly did they suffer, enduring privations now
undreamed of, and never complaining that theirs was a hard lot. We
stand with uncovered heads and with a reverent feeling in their
presence.

It is not possible to make due acknowledgments to all those who aided
in gathering the material in this volume. Many who came here in the
early years of the county have been consulted, and always with profit.
The drudgery of the work of making this book has been greatly lessened
by their courtesy and their help. We thank them all. Some of them have
been credited with their assistance in the narrative itself. In
addition to the names mentioned in the text we desire to give thanks
for aid and counsel to N. E. Brown, perhaps the best posted man in
Cedar Rapids on the early history of the city; to Ed. M. Scott, for
most valuable aid in the preparation of the chapter on banks and
banking; to Capt. J. O. Stewart and Col. W. G. Dows for appreciated
assistance in the writing of the chapter on our military history; to
Carle D. Brown, of the Commercial Art Press, who gathered most of the
illustrations for the volume; to W. F. Stahl, for aid in giving the
history of the United Brethren church in the county. Robert Ellis, Mrs.
Susan Mekeel, Mrs. Susan Shields, Mrs. Elizabeth Hrdlicka, Augustus
Abbe, J. H. Preston, C. G. Greene, J. S. Ely, Wm. Smyth, C. F. Butler,
L. W. Mansfield, and many others have assisted in gathering much
valuable material concerning the lives of the pioneers.

Much that has been gathered concerning times far removed from the
present, is from "hearsay," hence it has been difficult to be certain
as to the correct facts in some instances. Inaccuracies may be found,
but these are due to unavoidable omissions, largely on the part of
those who have related these happenings and not from any sense of bias
or prejudice.

All prior county histories have been consulted as well as the early
state gazetteers, Andreas' _Atlas_, Carroll's _History_, _History of
Crescent Lodge_, _History of the Bench and Bar of Iowa_, _History of
the Courts and Legal Profession_, _Proceedings_ of the Linn County
Historical Society; and the files of the newspapers published in the
county in an early day. It is needless to add that the early city
directories have been largely used with reference to the business men
of Cedar Rapids in the early days.

References to persons have been confined to mere statements of facts
and have been free from undue flattery on the one hand and from
anything derogatory on the other. The members of the legal and medical
professions have been referred to at some length for the reason that
the lawyers and doctors were important factors in pioneer days, both in
the organization of the county and in the promotion of the various
enterprises in our towns.

Trusting that this history may be of some value in preserving material
which ere long would pass beyond reach of preservation, this work is
respectfully dedicated to the early pioneers of the county, whose lives
and careers the authors have attempted to describe in the following
pages.

CHAPTER I

_The Birth of Iowa_


Iowa is known as a prairie state. Prairie is a French word and
signifies meadow. It was the name first applied to the great treeless
plains of North America by the French missionaries who were the first
white men to explore these regions.

As yet scientists have not been able to explain the origin of the
prairies. Different theories have been advanced, but the interesting
problem is without satisfactory and conclusive solution.

Agassiz, the scientist, maintained that America is not the "new world."
"Hers was the first dry land lifted out of the waters," he wrote; "hers
the first shores washed by the ocean that enveloped all the earth
besides; and while Europe was represented only by islands rising here
and there above the sea, America already stretched one unbroken line of
land from Nova Scotia to the far West."

Iowa, also, was born, had a beginning sometime. Just how many years ago
this interesting event took place it is difficult to approximate. Prof.
Samuel Calvin, state geologist, says that "geological records,
untampered with, and unimpeachable, declare that for uncounted years
Iowa, together with the great valley of the Mississippi, lay beneath
the level of the sea. So far as it was inhabited at all, marine forms
of animals and plants were its only occupants."

The soils of the state were produced by the action of the ice in what
is known as the glacial period. We are told how by Professor Calvin:

     "Glaciers and glacial action have contributed in a very
     large degree to the making of our magnificent State. What
     Iowa would have been had it never suffered from the effects
     of the ponderous ice sheets that successively overflowed its
     surface, is illustrated, but not perfectly, in the driftless
     area. Here we have an area that was not invaded by glaciers.
     Allamakee, parts of Jackson, Dubuque, Clayton, Fayette, and
     Winneshiek counties belong to the driftless area. During the
     last two decades deep wells have been bored through the
     loose surface deposit, and down into the underlying rocks.
     The record of these wells shows that the rock surface is
     very uneven. Before the glacial drift which now mantles
     nearly the whole of Iowa was deposited, the surface had been
     carved into an intricate system of hills and valleys. There
     were narrow gorges hundreds of feet in depth, and there were
     rugged, rocky cliffs, and isolated buttes corresponding in
     height with the depth of the valleys.

     "To a person passing from the drift-covered to the driftless
     part of the state, the topography presents a series of
     surprises. The principal drainage streams flow in valleys
     that measure, from the summits of the divides, six hundred
     or more in depth. The Oneota, or Upper Iowa River, in
     Allamakee county, for example, flows between picturesque
     cliffs that rise almost vertically from three to four
     hundred feet, while from the summit of the cliffs the land
     rises gradually to the crest of the divide, three, four or
     five miles back from the stream. Tributary streams cut the
     lateral slopes and canyon walls at intervals. These again
     have tributaries of the second order. In such a region a
     quarter section of level land would be a curiosity. This is
     a fair sample of what Iowa would have been had it not been
     planed down by the leveling effects of the glaciers. Soils
     of uniform excellence would have been impossible in a
     non-glacial Iowa. The soils of Iowa have a value equal to
     all of the silver and gold mines of the world combined.

     "And for this rich heritage of soils we are indebted to
     great rivers of ice that overflowed Iowa from the north and
     northwest. The glaciers in their long journey ground up the
     rocks over which they moved and mingled the fresh rock flour
     from granites of British America and northern Minnesota with
     pulverized limestones and shales of more southern regions,
     and used these rich materials in covering up the bald rocks
     and leveling the irregular surface of preglacial Iowa. The
     materials are in places hundreds of feet in depth. They are
     not oxidized or leached, but retain the carbonates and other
     soluble constituents that contribute so largely to the
     growth of plants. The physical condition of the materials is
     ideal, rendering the soil porous, facilitating the
     distribution of moisture, and offering unmatched
     opportunities for the employment of improved machinery in
     all of the processes connected with cultivation. Even the
     driftless area received great benefit from the action of
     glaciers, for although the area was not invaded by ice, it
     was yet to a large extent covered by a peculiar deposit
     called loess, which is generally connected with one of the
     later sheets of drift. The loess is a porous clay, rich in
     carbonate of lime. Throughout the driftless area it has
     covered up many spots that would otherwise have been bare
     rocks. It covered the stiff intractable clays that would
     otherwise have been the only soils of the region. It in
     itself constitutes a soil of great fertility. Every part of
     Iowa is debtor in some way to the great ice sheets of the
     glacial period.

       *       *       *       *       *

     "Soils are everywhere the product of rock disintegration,
     and so the quality of the soils in a given locality must
     necessarily be determined in large measure by the kind of
     rock from which they were derived.

     "From this point of view, therefore, the history of Iowa's
     superb soils begins with first steps in rock making. The
     very oldest rocks of the Mississippi Valley have contributed
     something to making our soils what they are, and every later
     formation laid down over the surface of Iowa, or regions
     north of it, has furnished its quota of materials to the
     same end. The history of Iowa's soils, therefore, embraces
     the whole sweep of geologic times.

     "The chief agents concerned in modifying the surface
     throughout most of Iowa since the disappearance of the
     latest glaciers have been organic, although the physical and
     chemical influences of air and water have not been without
     marked effect. The growth and decay of a long series of
     generations of plants have contributed certain organic
     constituents to the soil. Earth worms bring up fine material
     from considerable depths and place it in position to be
     spread out upon the surface. They drag leaves and any
     manageable portion of plants into their burrows, and much of
     the material so taken down into the ground decays and
     enriches the ground to a depth of several inches. The pocket
     gopher has done much to furnish a surface layer of loose,
     mellow, easily cultivated and highly productive soil. Like
     the earth worm, the gopher for century after century has
     been bringing up to the surface fine material, to the amount
     of several tons annually to the acre, avoiding necessarily
     the pebbles, cobbles and coarser constituents. The burrows
     collapse, the undermined boulders and large fragments sink
     downwards, rains and winds spread out the gopher hills and
     worm castings, and the next year, and the next, the process
     is repeated; and so it has been for all the years making up
     the centuries since the close of the glacial epoch. Organic
     agents in the form of plants and burrowing animals have
     worked unremittingly through many centuries, and
     accomplished a work of incalculable value in pulverizing,
     mellowing and enriching the superficial stratum, and
     bringing it to the ideal condition in which it was found by
     the explorers and pioneers from whose advent dates the
     historical period of our matchless Iowa."

The last invasion, we are informed, was from 100,000 to 170,000 years
ago--somewhat prior to the recollection of the "oldest inhabitant."




CHAPTER II

_The First Inhabitants_


Who were Iowa's first inhabitants is a question of some interest.
Archeologists tell us that there have been found in the Mississippi
Valley the remains of two distinct prehistoric races. The first human
skulls discovered resemble those of the gorilla. These skulls indicate
a low degree of intelligence. The first inhabitants were but a grade
above the lower animals. They were small in body, and brute-like in
appearance.

Next came the "mound builders." There are evidences that these had some
degree of intelligence. Copper and stone implements have been found in
the mounds. Whether they built towns and cities or tilled the soil is
not known. Pieces of cloth discovered in the mounds would indicate some
knowledge of the arts. Their number, their size, color, customs--all
are lost to us. We know they existed, and that is all. Several of these
mounds have been explored in Iowa. They are found in the eastern parts
of the state from Dubuque to Burlington. Many interesting articles have
been found in them--sea shells, copper axes and spools, stone knives,
pottery, pipes carved with effigies of animals and birds. Skeletons and
altars of stone were unearthed a few years ago in some of these mounds,
and in one were discovered hieroglyphics representing letters and
figures of trees, people and animals.

These mounds have also been discovered in the central part of the
state, the valley of the Des Moines river being especially rich in
them. Sometimes they are in groups, as though built for defense. It has
been suggested that probably the conquerors of the mound builders were
the immediate ancestors of the Indians.

When on June 25, 1673, Marquette and Joliet fastened their frail craft
to the west bank of the Mississippi river where the Iowa enters it in
Louisa county,[A] the only people living in what is now Iowa were the
American Indians. When these venturesome explorers came ashore and
ascended a slight eminence they beheld a scene of rare beauty. As far
as the eye could carry they looked over an expanse covered with green
grass waving in the gentle wind like the billows of the sea, with here
and there a grove of oak, elm, walnut, maple, and sycamore. All was
peaceful, calm, and restful; the stillness of the desert prevailed.
That the country was inhabited was indicated by a thin column of smoke
which arose some few miles inland from a small grove. The travelers
soon reached the spot. There they found a small company of Indians in a
village on the banks of the stream. The Indians were probably the more
astonished of the two parties. They looked with wonder upon the strange
beings who had come among them so unceremoniously and unannounced. It
was probably their first view of the white man. Recovering somewhat
from their astonishment, they made overtures of friendship by offering
the pipe of peace.

It was soon discovered that the band was a portion of the Illinois
tribe. Marquette had enough acquaintance with the language of this
tribe to enable him to hold an intelligent conversation with his hosts.
He told the Indians who their visitors were, and why they were there.
He expressed the great pleasure he and his companions took at meeting
some of the inhabitants of that beautiful country. They in turn were
given a cordial welcome by the Indians, one of the chiefs thus
addressing them:

     "I thank the Black Gown Chief [Marquette] and his friend
     [Joliet] for taking so much pains to come and visit us.
     Never before has the earth been so beautiful, nor the sun so
     bright as now. Never has the river been so calm or free from
     rocks which your canoes have removed as they passed down.
     Never has the tobacco had so fine a flavor, nor our corn
     appeared so beautiful as we behold it today. Ask the Great
     Spirit to give us life and health, and come ye and dwell
     with us."

This was an eloquent speech and demonstrated the sincerity of the
welcome.

Marquette and Joliet were then invited to a feast which meanwhile had
been made ready by the squaws. Afterwards Marquette wrote a description
of this banquet, and it is of interest to reproduce it here:

     "It consisted of four courses. First there was a large
     wooden bowl filled with a preparation of corn meal boiled in
     water and seasoned with oil. The Indian conducting the
     ceremonies had a large wooden spoon with which he dipped up
     the mixture (called by the Indians _tagamity_), passing it
     in turn into the mouths of the different members of the
     party. The second course consisted of fish nicely cooked,
     which was separated from the bones and placed in the mouths
     of the guests. The third course was a roasted dog, which our
     explorers declined with thanks, when it was at once removed
     from sight. The last course was a roast of buffalo, the
     fattest pieces of which were passed the Frenchmen, who found
     it to be most excellent meat."

The Frenchmen were so delighted with the beauty of the country and the
hospitality of the Indians that they remained with their friends six
days. They explored the valleys, hunted and fished and feasted on the
choice game they captured. The natives did all they could to make their
stay one gay round of pleasure. They welcomed the coming guests with
genuine hospitality, and when they could keep them no longer speeded
them on their way in the true spirit. Six hundred of them escorted
Marquette and Joliet to their boats and wished them bon voyage.

This discovery attracted but little attention at the time in Europe,
and many years passed before what is now known as Iowa appears in
history.


THE MOUND BUILDERS

The Mound Builders, from what information we have been able to obtain,
must have lived in the Mississippi valley and at one time or another
way back in some remote age they must have resided on what later became
Iowa. Chronology is not definite as to when or how the Mound Builders
arrived in the new world. It is merely speculation when one says that
traditions point to a time two or three thousand years ago when the
Mound Builders resided in the Mississippi valley and lived in villages
and towns. It is true, that in various parts of the old world records
have been found of other races which have preceded the races of which
history has any definite record. As the North American Indians had no
written language prior to the arrival of the Europeans, their
traditions, consequently, go back but a short time at best.

It is true that there have been found on the American continent various
bones of animals which no longer exist, and there have been found
relics of a race of men who were far different from the Indians as the
whites found them on their arrival. In North America these pre-historic
races have been called Mound Builders, and they have been the first
inhabitants of the vast plains of what later became the United States.
Still, it may be possible that the Mound Builders may have driven out
or exterminated some other preceding race of people, who had dwelt in
this country for ages before the Mound Builders made their entrance
into what is known as the New World. Who knows?

[Illustration: B. L. WICK]

In Johnson's _Encyclopedia_, Vol. 1, page 125, one finds the following:
"Remains of the Mound Builders are spread over a vast extent of
country. They are found on the sources of the Alleghany, in the western
part of the state of New York, and in nearly all the western states,
including Michigan and Iowa. They were observed by Lewis and Clark on
the Missouri a thousand miles above its junction with the Mississippi.
They lined the shores of the Gulf of Mexico from Texas to Florida,
whence they extended through Alabama and Georgia into South Carolina.
They are especially numerous in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Texas. Many of these remnants were
evidently designed as works of defense or as large towers in war. No
inconsiderable number appear to have been formed as sepulchre monuments
or as places of burial for the dead, while others seemed obviously to
have been constructed as temples or places of worship or sacrifice."

While Linn county and Iowa have not as many mounds of as much interest
as, for example, the Circle Mound in Ohio, still there are a number of
mounds found in eastern Iowa and a number in Linn county which would
appear to have been constructed by Mound Builders, or, at least, by
some pre-historic race long since extinct. Some mounds found near Palo
would indicate that they must have been constructed a long time ago,
for even trees of large dimensions have been found growing on top and
around these mounds. The remnants certainly give evidence in places as
though they had been constructed for religious purposes, which
evidently is true of nearly all such remnants which have recently been
discovered in Yucatan and Mexico.

Some stone implements and ornaments have been found in some of these
mounds. These implements are all flint spear and arrow heads and have
been worked with much care and skill. Some pottery has also been
discovered, at times ornamented and at other times very coarse. Some
copper implements have been found of a kind and quality as discovered
in the copper region of Lake Superior, which, undoubtedly, have been
worked by the Indians and perhaps by the Mound Builders. No bones have
so far been discovered to indicate that the Mound Builders had the use
of any domestic animals. Very seldom have human skeletons been found,
which might attest to the fact that these had been dug ages and ages
ago. No tablets of any kind have been discovered, which might indicate
that the Mound Builders had at no time a written language.

Science has held that the Mound Builders were an agricultural people
and compared with the Indians much more civilized, and that the
Mississippi valley was densely populated until the arrival of the
Indians. Whether the Indians exterminated them or they were driven
away, or they voluntarily removed from this part of the country is
still a debatable question.

     "If it is really true that there were pre-historic peoples,
     then the oldest continent would be, in all probability, the
     first inhabited; and as this is the oldest continent in the
     formations of the geological period, and as there are found
     relics of man in England in identically the same strata as
     are shown in Linn county, why may we not reasonably expect
     to find relics of man--relics as old as any--in Linn county?
     If man once existed here, why may he not have always existed
     here? It is certainly unreasonable to think young Europe
     should alone have early relics of man.

     "What place the Mound Builders are entitled to in the
     world's history, since they have left no relics but mounds
     of earth, which mounds are probably funeral pyres or places
     of sepulchre, we can simply conjecture. We believe some rude
     carvings on slabs have been exhumed at Grand Traverse,
     Michigan, Davenport, Iowa, and Rockford, Illinois. These
     carvings may have reference to the sun, moon and stars; we
     believe the savants favor such an interpretation. As to
     where he lived, careful geological study of his mound may
     some day determine. He was a link in the chain of man's
     existence; tracing it to its source we may discover some
     hitherto unknown facts regarding man's origin, or the
     ancient history of America. This continent may have been
     more intimately connected with Asia than is at present
     considered....

     "Compare the average life of these nations with the age of
     the Cedar valley; compare historic age with Cedar valley,
     whose channel has been cut down through the rocks between
     one and two hundred feet. Look at these old Devonian rocks,
     with their fossils as fresh as of yesterday. Look at the
     clay soil that overlies the rocks. Has it been changed in
     fourteen hundred or in six thousand years? Now look at those
     mounds that are on the crests of so many ridges, and say how
     old they are! Forests of giant trees have come and gone over
     them, how many times? Those mounds were built by the people
     known as the Mound Builders. What of their life? What of
     their age? What of their history? We have the mounds, and
     substantially the mounds only. But these mounds are an
     interesting study of themselves. We have not observed these
     mounds only in the valley of the Cedar river, above and
     below Cedar Rapids; our observations find them in positions
     as follows:

     "No. 1 has eleven mounds, situated on the crest of a divide.
     The general direction of locations is from north to south,
     or south to north. The correct location, I believe, is from
     south to north; that is, they point to the north. These
     mounds are now raised about three feet above the level, and
     are uniformly thirty feet in diameter. Counting from the
     south, the sixth and seventh are generally within a few
     feet--come very near touching each other; the others are as
     near as, may be, two diameters apart. These remarks will
     apply to No. 2, No. 3, No. 5 and No. 6. No. 2 has eleven in
     a line (as No. 1,) and then three mounds to the east appear
     to be parallel, and may have had the remaining eight removed
     by cultivation. No. 4 is on the bottom--second bench land;
     are a little larger in size; the others, to make out the
     eleven, may have been destroyed by cultivation. No. 7 has
     eight in position, and then a valley intervenes, and the
     three additional, making the eleven, are on the ridge next
     to the north. No. 8 has twelve. They are on the crest of a
     divide which passes around the head of a deep ravine, and
     follow the divide at the angle. Most of these mounds (No. 8)
     have been lately opened, but we think no relics were found.
     We have been careful to find the place that the earth
     composing the mounds was taken from. Generally, the banks
     of a near ravine indicate, by their shape, the place. Under
     the strongest sunlight, in a mound cut through the center,
     we could detect no indication or difference in the clay to
     show that it had been removed or disturbed, or that there
     had been any remains in it to discolor the clay in their
     decomposition.

     "Let it be observed that the mounds are substantially north
     and south in line of location. They are eleven in number,
     uniform in size, and, I believe, cover every ridge in the
     vicinity of the rapids of the Cedar having the direction
     sufficient in length on which the mounds could be placed.
     They are built in the locality the least likely to be
     disturbed, and in the shape and of the material the most
     enduring. There certainly was intelligence displayed in
     their location and in the selection of the material of which
     they are constructed, as well as in the design of their form
     and positions. There may have been more mounds than these,
     but these are all that are left--all that are left of that
     race which might have sent from their number emigrants to
     people the new land, to the far west, the last continent,
     fresh and vigorous from the ocean, the newest born, the best
     then adapted for man's material and mental
     development."--_History of Linn County_, 1878, p. 319.

J. S. Newberry, in Johnson's _Cyclopedia_, says:

     "From all the facts before us, we can at present say little
     more than this, that the valley of the Mississippi and the
     Atlantic coast were once densely populated by a sedentary,
     agricultural and partially civilized race, quite different
     from the modern nomadic Indians, though, possibly, the
     progenitors of some of the Indian tribes; and that, after
     many centuries of occupation, they disappeared from our
     country at least one thousand, perhaps many thousands of
     years, before the advent of the Europeans. The pre-historic
     remains found so abundantly in Arizona appear to be related
     to the civilization of Mexico; and the remains of
     semi-civilized Indian tribes now found there are, perhaps,
     descendants of the ancient builders of the great houses and
     cities whose ruins are found there."

Researches concerning ancient mounds have been carried on in a most
scientific manner by Dr. Cyrus Thomas. His chief work and research have
been embodied in a monograph of over 700 pages and found the 12th
Report of the government publications.

Major J. W. Powell, whose studies of this subject have been considered
authoritative, in his _Pre-historic Man in America_ has the following
to say:

     "Widely scattered throughout the United States ...
     artificial mounds are discovered which may be enumerated by
     thousands and hundreds of thousands. They vary greatly in
     size. Some are small so that half a dozen laborers with
     shovels might construct one of them in a day, while others
     cover acres and are scores of feet in height. These mounds
     were observed by the early explorers and pioneers of the
     country.... Pseud-archeologists descanted on the Mound
     Builders, that once inhabited the land, and they told of
     swarming populations who had reached a high condition of
     culture, erecting temples, practicing arts in metals and
     using hieroglyphics.... It is enough to say that the Mound
     Builders were the Indian tribes discovered by the white men.
     It may well be that some of the mounds were erected by
     tribes extinct when Columbus first saw the shores, but they
     were kindred in culture to the peoples that still
     existed.... Pre-Columbian culture was indigenous, it began
     at the lowest stage of savagery and developed to the highest
     and was in many places passing into barbarism when the good
     queen sold her jewels."--J. W. Powell, quoted in _Larned_,
     Vol. I, p. 45.

Thus scientists do not agree whether or not the Mound Builders were
closely akin to the Indians. However recent investigators seem to agree
with Thomas and Powell that the early inhabitants were much like the
later denizens of the American prairies in their mode of life and means
of subsistence, in their weapons, arts, usages, and customs, in their
institutions and physical characteristics, they were the same people in
different stages of advancement.

John Fiske, one of the scholarly writers on American history, has the
following to say on the early races in the United States:

     "Whether the Indians are descended from this ancient
     population or not, is a question with which we have as yet
     no satisfactory method of dealing. It is not unlikely that
     these glacial men may have perished from off the face of the
     earth, having been crushed and supplanted by stronger races.
     There may have been several successive waves of migration of
     which the Indians were the latest."--Fiske's _Discovery of
     America_, Vol. I, p. 15.

     "The aboriginal American, as we know him with his language
     and legends, his physical and mental peculiarities, his
     social observance and customs, is most emphatically a native
     and not an imported article. He belongs to the American
     continent as strictly as its opossums and armadillo, its
     maize and its golden rods, or any number of its aboriginal
     fauna and flora belong to it."--_Ibid._, p. 20.

An Iowa investigator, C. L. Webster, some years ago examined several
mounds on the banks of the Cedar river near Charles City and "found the
skulls small which would show an extremely low grade of mental
intelligence."--_American Naturalist_, Vol. 23, p. 1888.

This may go to show that the early inhabitants were different from the
nomadic Indians that the first whites saw as they landed on the bleak
shores of New England in the eleventh century.

Most writers on this subject are led to believe that we have conclusive
evidence that man existed before the time of the glaciers and that from
primitive conditions he has lived here and developed through the same
stages which may correspond to the development of primitive man in
Europe and Asia. Whether the first settlers in Iowa then, were Mound
Builders, or Indians, or some other race may never be known, for a
certainty. It is enough to say, that man existed and lived on what has
become known as Iowa many, many centuries ago, and he left few if any
remains which can testify to his stage of development or to his mode of
living. This is no doubt true, that man existed in Linn county
countless ages ago, but whether it was a different race, or simply the
Indian race at a different stage of development may never be known and
thus will always remain a mystery.


INDIANS

When the first white settlers located in Linn county the Red Men still
occupied the land, and even after treaties had been fully ratified,
Indians were slow to give up these choice hunting places along the Red
Cedar and the Wapsie. It is needless to say that the rights of Indians
were not protected and they invariably were set aside and driven away
as fast as possible. Still nearly all of the early settlers were very
friendly toward the Red Men, and in return received many favors from
their hands. Of course, the Red Men were jealous of the whites, who
gradually kept coming in and drove the Indians away. The Indians who
most frequented this part of Iowa after the settlement by whites were
the Sac and Fox and Winnebagoes. The Winnebagoes were a remnant of a
warlike tribe, and at one time in Wisconsin were very powerful. These
joined with the Sac and Fox in the Black Hawk war and were driven
across the Mississippi river after the signing of the treaty of peace.

The pioneers in this county from necessity had to be friendly with the
Indians. Many of the early settlers were able to speak the Winnebago
language, such as the family of William Abbe, the Edgertons, the Usher
family, the Crows, and many others. The Winnebagoes lingered around in
this part of Iowa in the thirties and forties, when they were finally
removed to Minnesota, much against their own wishes. But the Indians,
rightly in this respect as in many others, were not considered, for the
white men ruled and looked out for their own selfish interests and did
not consider the side of mercy, justice or the rights of the weak as
against those of the strong.

The Winnebagoes were considered a hardy race and respected by the
whites, who showed them many favors. While the Winnebagoes had fought
in the war of 1812 under Tecumseh and had sided with Black Hawk,
perhaps reluctantly, in the war of 1832, they were rather friendly
toward the whites, although they very much objected to disposing of all
their lands east of the Mississippi river by the treaties of 1825 and
1837, when they were removed to Iowa. In Linn county they remained for
a longer or shorter period of time along the rivers such as the Cedar
and the Wapsie, and especially around Cedar Lake, along the Palisades,
in Linn Grove, Scotch Grove west of Cedar Rapids, and in other places
where there was much timber. While they were at times heartless and
cruel, their relations on the whole with the early settlers in Linn
county were those of friendship, and they showed the whites many favors
in the early days when the scattered pioneer families were unable to
acquire sufficient food during the winter months to subsist upon. The
Indians always helped the whites, and frequently went out hunting,
bringing back a deer, fowls, or prairie chickens, which they divided
among their own people and the whites. They early became fond of the
dishes made by the white women, such as hominy, honey cakes, johnny
cakes, and other delicious dishes found in the homes of the early
settlers on the frontier. In no instance has it been reported that any
white woman was ever assaulted by any Indian in this county. In many of
the cabins of the early settlers there could be found only women and
children, the husbands having left for the river towns to bring back
provisions, and this fact was frequently known to the Indians. The
early pioneer women used to say that they feared the rough border
ruffian more than they did these traveling bands of Indians, who never
assaulted anyone or ever carried away property by stealth, as the
border ruffians were frequently accused of doing.

The story of the Winnebago tribe of Indians can not be passed without
some notice. The name Winnebago is said to mean "the turbid water
people," and they are closely related to the Iowas, Otoes, and the
Missouri tribes. They used to call themselves the Hochangara, meaning
"the people using the parent tongue," thus, perhaps, intending to
convey that they were the original people from whom others sprang. They
are first mentioned in the Jesuit Relations of 1636 and 1640. It is
said that they were nearly annihilated by the Illinois tribes in early
days and that the survivors fled back to Green Bay in 1737 and that
they resided on the banks of Lake Superior but once more drifted back
to Green Bay and towards Lake Winnebago, stretching southwest towards
the Mississippi river. On one of the islands in the lake which bears
their name they made their abiding place for a number of years and here
they buried their dead and dwelt in peace around their fire places.

In 1825 the population was estimated to be 6,000. By the treaties of
1825 and 1832 they were compelled to cede their lands to the
government, certain tracts of land being reserved on the Mississippi
river near what is now known as La Crosse. Here they suffered from
several visitations of smallpox, which plague is said to have carried
off nearly one-fourth of their number.

From 1834-35 they were removed to Iowa and lived along the many rivers
in the northeastern part of the Territory as far as the banks of the
Cedar and the Wapsie rivers. White settlers came in, driving the Red
Men out: hunting became poor and the Indians could not subsist and
they were again removed to the Blue Earth reservation in Minnesota in
1848. On account of the Indian outbreaks in 1863, committed by the
Sioux tribe, and in which the Winnebagoes took no part, they were again
removed to the Dakotas, where several hundred perished from cold and
hunger. There are now only about 1,200 under the Omaha and Winnebago
agency in Nebraska, and about 1,500 in the state of Wisconsin.

The Sac and Fox were also the early neighbors of the whites in this
county. The Fox was an Algonkian tribe, first found on the lakes, and
who were driven south by the Ojibwa where, for self protection, they
united with the Sacs and have been since known as Sacs and Foxes. They
were always friendly to the British, joining them in the Revolution as
well as in the war of 1812. After the Black Hawk war they were removed
to Iowa and from here removed again to the Indian Territory from
1842-46. Many of the tribes kept coming back to their old hunting
ground and finally they were permitted to remain on the Iowa river and
provision for them was made by the legislature. About 400, known as the
Muskwaki, are still found, survivors of some of the early wanderers in
eastern Iowa in the early thirties. The Sacs and Foxes and the
Winnebagoes were always on friendly terms with the whites and were
sworn enemies of the Sioux.

Mrs. Susan Shields, a daughter of William Abbe, was on intimate terms
with the Winnebago Indians, who used to gather at her father's home on
Abbe's creek frequently. She learned to speak the Winnebago language,
and remembered seeing many wigwams, or tepees as they were called, at
the lower end of what is now Cedar Rapids. She speaks of the Indians as
being kind to her and that her first playmates were Indian girls of her
own age. Her brothers also played with the Indian boys and they learned
to ride Indian ponies and to shoot with bows and arrows. No trouble
ever arose among the young of both races in these days; rather the
white boys were envious to see the liberties granted the Indian boys
and how they were permitted to roam any place at pleasure, never having
any chores to do.

Robert Ellis understood more or less of the Indian jargon, and still
speaks of his many escapades among the Sioux, the Winnebago, and the
Sac and Fox. At one time, about 1839, some 300 Winnebagoes were camped
on what is known as McCloud's Run. It was late in the fall and very
cold; word came in the night that the Sioux were coming to exterminate
the tribe. At once they broke camp and forded the river near the mill
dam, first getting the women and children across. The white settlers
were frightened. By nine o'clock the next morning the camps were up on
the west side of the river and the gay young bucks had brought in
thirty-eight deer which had been shot during the early morning, which
were served to the hungry lot who had worked all night. While the Sioux
had been in the neighborhood no attack was made upon the Winnebagoes at
this time.

Mr. Ellis also relates that he and two friends camped one night on the
Cedar above Waterloo, where they were hunting. One morning in
mid-winter a party of Sioux came to the cabin. They could do nothing
but invite the Red Men in and offer them provisions and anything they
had. While the Indians kicked against the whites killing their game,
the friendliness of the whites seemed to satisfy them, and they left
their new found friends in possession of their camps. After this
discovery by the Sioux Mr. Ellis and his friends made a hasty retreat,
not wanting to meet their dusky companions again when they might return
in larger numbers.

Mr. Ellis relates another incident of his life among the Indians. He
came to an Indian camp near Quasqueton on his way to Ft. Atkinson and
had to spend the night in the camp. Unfortunately nearly all of the
Indians were drunk and insisted on killing every one. The squaws, who
were sober, and a few of the old men, got Mr. Ellis to help, and all
the drunken bucks were tied so they could scarcely move. Mr. Ellis then
retired, and in the morning all were sober and untied, and then the
squaws and the old men who had been sober started in to get gloriously
drunk. Mr. Ellis wanted to hire an Indian to show him the way to West
Union, but the Indian shrugged his shoulders and replied, "wolf eaty
you." Mr. Ellis started out alone afoot over the snow covered prairie
on a cold winter day and finally reached a cabin late at night, nearly
overcome from cold. He still believes he would have perished if it had
not been for the words of the old Indian which kept ringing in his ears
all day and which added courage to his exhausted spirits.

At one time a large number of Muskwaki Indians were camping near Indian
creek, and as the winter was severe and snow deep the Indians were out
of food. They came to the home of Susan Doty, who gave them the best
and only thing she had--hominy--which she warmed on the fire and gave
to the Red Men, who expressed their thanks by grunting and continually
asking for more, till the entire supply was exhausted. From that time,
when the Indians returned from the hunt with a deer or two Mrs. Doty
was always remembered with a good share of game.

When the Indians lost ponies they would go to the old settlers like
Usher, N. B. Brown, the Hunters, Oxleys, or Dotys, asking them to
assist in catching the thieves. One day Usher and Brown came to Doty's
with an Indian chief who had lost his pony. Hunter was also called in,
and off the party started in pursuit of the horsethief, who was caught
near Viola and who made himself scarce at once, for he was branded as
an outlaw by the Indians, who would shoot him at sight. The Indian was
more than happy in getting back his pony. These men who were willing to
help the Indians were sure to get anything they cared for which could
be procured by the red brother. A white man who would help an Indian to
recover stolen property was forever a friend of the Indians of the
tribe.

The Indians in Linn county during the thirties and forties dressed in
skins, lived in tepees, and owned ponies; all wore government blankets
and had guns, also procured from the government. The men and women
dressed much the same. The women carried home the game, looked after
the tepee, made maple sugar, which was traded to the whites for sugar,
flour, and woolen goods. Flour especially was much relished by the
Indians. The localities much frequented by the Indians were along the
Red Cedar and Wapsie rivers, Cedar lake, Indian creek, the Palisades,
Linn Grove, Scotch Grove, and Prairie creek. In these places they would
remain for weeks at a time, when they would all pull up and leave on
some hunting trip, not returning till in the fall or spring of the
year. Where they went to no one knew, and where they came from no one
inquired. But the Red Men in early days in this county were all treated
with due courtesy by the whites, who, in turn, were spared by the
Indians. The best of feeling always existed among the whites and
Indians.

The Sioux very seldom came into this part of Iowa. William Abbe and
Robert Ellis were the agents for the government in supplying the
Winnebago Indians at Ft. Atkinson with food, thus these men were well
acquainted with the Winnebagoes, who, in turn, were on terms of
friendship with the Sacs and Foxes. The Winnebagoes, like the other
tribes, became addicted to the use of fire water to such an extent that
they would sell their guns and ammunition for whiskey. One of the early
experiences of W. H. Merritt as a young store keeper at Ivanhoe was to
clean out the store single-handed of a crowd of drunken Indians who
intended to take possession of the store for a sufficient length of
time at least till they could consume the large quantity of whiskey
stored therein, but they had not figured on the courage of the young
man who later distinguished himself during the Civil war. Young Mr.
Merritt drove out the intruders and saved the store, as well as the
property of the company for which he worked.

Many of the old settlers tell stories of the quantity and variety of
food these wandering tribes of Indians were capable of consuming, which
seemed to be beyond the comprehension of the white man. Mr. Ellis
relates how he and William Abbe were notified to forthwith procure beef
cattle for an Indian conference at Ft. Atkinson. These men promptly
drove a large number of young cattle to Ft. Atkinson from Linn county,
and the Indians consumed in a very short time rations which were
expected to have lasted for several weeks.

Others have left records of straggling bands of Indians who were fed at
some pioneer cabin and consumed quantities of food at a sitting several
times more than the ordinary white man could eat in a week. But then it
must be remembered that these Indians did not have their regular meals
three times a day, by any means. They seemed to go for days and for a
week without eating much of anything, and when a feast was set before
them they did full justice to the repast.

The Indians had an abnormal fondness for sweets. The making of maple
sugar, especially in Wisconsin, had been one of the industries of the
aborigines; a little was always made in Iowa. The season for sugar
making came when the first crow appeared; this occurred about the first
of March, while there was yet snow on the ground. As a substitute for
sugar the Indians were very fond of honey, and it was said by the early
settlers that the squaws could smell a bee tree further than anyone
else. These bee trees were claimed by the Indians, and woe to the white
man's son who by stealth or otherwise would encroach upon the Indian's
rights in this regard.

While the Indians were called cruel and merciless during the Black Hawk
war and later, the pioneers of Linn county found them friendly,
hospitable, devoted and loyal friends. Many instances have been cited
how the Red Men risked their own lives even to assist their white
friends. While they never forgave an injury, they never forgot a deed
of kindness.

CHAPTER III

_Iowa Historically_


We take the liberty of quoting here a chapter from "The Louisiana
Purchase," by C. M. Geer, in _The History of North America_, Vol. VIII,
edited by Guy Carleton Lee, and published by George Barrie & Sons,
Philadelphia, 1904. It gives in brief space the more important
historical facts connected with the formation of the State.

     "The governmental experiences of Iowa before its admission
     into the Union as a State were many and varied. Its
     discoverers were the missionary priest Jacques Marquette and
     the explorer Louis Joliet, who were living at St. Mary's,
     the oldest settlement in the present State of Michigan. On
     May 13, 1673, with five Canadian boatmen, these two men left
     on an exploring expedition, and on June 25, 1673, landed
     near the mouth of Des Moines River.[B] By right of discovery
     France claimed jurisdiction over the country thus visited
     until 1763, when the Territory was ceded to Spain. On
     October 1, 1800, it was ceded with the rest of Louisiana
     Territory from Spain back to France. On the 30th of April,
     1803, it was in turn ceded to the United States by France as
     a part of the Louisiana Purchase.

     "These changes of government had little effect upon what was
     to constitute the future State of Iowa, because the Indians
     remained in almost undisputed possession. Although
     discovered and claimed by France in 1673, no attempt at
     settlement was made until 1788, when Julian Dubuque, a
     Canadian, obtained from Blondeau and two other Indian chiefs
     a grant of lands. This claim was twenty-one miles long and
     extended from the Mississippi westward nine miles. The grant
     was confirmed, in a qualified way, by Carondelet, Spanish
     governor at New Orleans. Dubuque engaged in mining and
     trading with the Indians, making his headquarters at the
     place which now bears his name. The question of the validity
     of his claim to this great tract of land came before the
     United States Supreme Court in 1854, and the decision of
     that body was that his grant was only a temporary license to
     dig ore.

     "In 1799, a trading post was established on the Mississippi
     within the present territory of Iowa. This settlement and
     the one at Dubuque were abandoned, so that Iowa was
     practically an unknown and undesired country at the time
     when it came under the control of the United States in 1803.
     It was at that time Indian territory, occupied by the Sacs,
     Foxes, and Iowas, with the still more warlike Sioux on the
     north and east.

     "On the 31st of October, 1803, a temporary government was
     authorized for the recently acquired territory. By Act of
     Congress, approved March 26, 1803, Louisiana was erected
     into two Territories and provision made for the
     administration of each. The upper part was known as the
     District of Louisiana and included Arkansas, Missouri, and
     Iowa. This was placed temporarily under the jurisdiction of
     the Territory of Indiana. On July 4, 1805, all this northern
     district became the Territory of Louisiana, with a separate
     Territorial government. The legislative power was vested in
     the governor and three judges to be appointed by the
     President and Senate. This condition continued until
     December 7, 1812, when the Territory of Louisiana became the
     Territory of Missouri. In 1821, Missouri was admitted into
     the Union, and this admission of Missouri carried with it
     the abolition of the government of Missouri Territory, so
     that for a time Iowa was without any government. It is a
     question how much law remained in force in Iowa after the
     admission of Missouri. It is probable that the only civil
     law in force was the proviso of the Missouri bill, which
     prohibited slavery north of thirty-six degrees thirty
     minutes north latitude. No provision was made for that
     portion of the Territory of Missouri until June 28, 1834,
     when Congress attached the present State of Iowa, together
     with other territory, to the Territory of Michigan.

     "On July 3, 1836, it was included in the newly organized
     Territory of Wisconsin. On June 12, 1838, the Territory of
     Iowa was constituted by Act of Congress. This Territory
     included 'all that part of the present Territory of
     Wisconsin which lies west of Mississippi River and west of a
     line due north from the sources or headwaters of the
     Mississippi to the territorial line.'

     "From the time of the purchase in 1803 up to the date of the
     organization of the Territory in 1838 there had been a
     gradual increase in the knowledge of this land and a growing
     appreciation of its value. There had been parties of hunters
     and trappers who made temporary settlements on the banks of
     the Mississippi in the period from 1820 to 1830. It was not
     till steam navigation was established on the Mississippi
     that there grew up a demand for Iowa lands. Southeastern
     Illinois and northwestern Missouri were settled and the
     pioneers naturally looked to the equally desirable lands in
     Iowa. Various exploring expeditions also contributed to a
     desire to settle in the territory. Lewis and Clark added to
     the knowledge of its western borders by their expedition in
     1805. Pike in the same year traversed another part of the
     Territory, and these explorers brought back accounts of its
     great fertility and of its desirability for settlement.

     "The government established a broad strip of neutral ground
     between the Sioux in the north and the Sacs and Foxes in the
     south to keep these tribes at peace, and in 1830 acquired
     lands on the Missouri to be used as Indian reservations.
     Here and there in the Iowa Territory were white men who had
     gained the friendship of the Indians and lived with them.
     There were trading posts of the American Fur Company and
     miners at Dubuque, who were licensed by the government to
     work at that point. Iowa remained the home of the Indians
     until the close of the Black Hawk War, when General Winfield
     Scott, on September 15, 1832, concluded a treaty of peace
     with the Sacs and Foxes, by which the Indian title was
     extinguished to that part of land known as the Black Hawk
     Purchase. This was the eastern part of Iowa and extended
     along the Mississippi, from Missouri on the south to the
     'Neutral Grounds' on the north, and westward a distance of
     fifty miles. It contained about six million acres and was to
     be surrendered by the Indians on June 1, 1833. This gave the
     first opportunity for the legal settlement of Iowa by
     citizens of the United States.

     "June 1, 1833, was fixed as the day on which the Indians
     were to be removed from the Black Hawk Purchase and the
     lands opened for settlement. The would-be settlers came in
     large numbers to the banks of the Mississippi, ready to
     cross and get the choice of the land. United States troops
     kept guard on the western shore of the river and prevented
     any persons from entering the Purchase before the appointed
     time. At precisely twelve o'clock, midnight, June 1st, there
     was a wild rush of settlers from East and South and the
     settlement of Iowa was begun.

     "There was a rapid increase in population until the separate
     Territorial government was established, June 12, 1838. The
     first capital was Burlington, and the place of meeting of
     the legislature was in a church. Robert Lucas was appointed
     Territorial Governor, and William B. Conway, Secretary. The
     Territorial Legislature met on November 12, 1838.
     Burlington continued to be the seat of Territorial
     government till 1841, when Iowa City became the capital.

     "The Territory of Iowa had a heated dispute with the State
     of Missouri over the boundary line between the two.
     Missouri's northern boundary was the parallel of latitude
     passing through the rapids of the river Des Moines. There
     were two rapids, eight or ten miles apart, and the dispute
     was as to which of these was meant, Missouri insisting upon
     the northern and Iowa on the southern one. Each government
     tried to enforce its authority. In the attempt to do this,
     Governor Boggs, of Missouri, called out the militia; then
     Governor Lucas, of Iowa, called out his soldiers. Five
     hundred men were under arms. On the petitions of Iowa and
     Missouri, Congress authorized a suit to settle the
     controversy, which resulted in a decision favorable to Iowa.

     "Further treaties were made with the Indians by which
     additional land was gained for settlement. A large tract of
     land was opened to settlers on May 1, 1843, and on the
     preceding night there was a rush of land seekers similar to
     that which had occurred ten years before; over a thousand
     families settled in the newly opened lands within twelve
     hours.

     "The very rapid increase in population led to a demand for
     statehood. On July 31, 1840, the Territorial Legislature
     passed an Act by which it called for a vote of the people on
     the question of assembling a constitutional convention. In
     August the vote was taken, resulting in the defeat of the
     proposition by a vote of two thousand nine hundred and seven
     to nine hundred and thirty-seven. Another vote was taken in
     1842, resulting in the same way, but on February 12, 1844,
     the suggestion of a constitutional convention met the
     approval of the majority of the electors, and without
     waiting for a Federal Enabling Act a Constitution was
     adopted by a convention which met at Iowa City, October 7,
     1844, and finished its work November 1st of the same year.
     This Constitution was submitted to Congress by the
     Territorial delegate.

     "Here again there was the effort to balance a northern and
     southern State. Maine had been admitted into the Union in
     1820, and Missouri in 1821; Arkansas in 1836, and Michigan
     in the next year. Now, it was proposed to admit Florida with
     Iowa. At this time Florida was much below the required
     population. The Congressional debate on the subject was a
     long and interesting one and brought out clearly the growing
     jealousy between North and South. This feeling was
     especially strong at this time because of the probability
     that several southern slaveholding States might be formed
     from Texas.

     "There was furthermore a dispute of considerable importance
     over the general boundary of Iowa. The Constitution
     submitted to Congress by the Territorial delegate provided
     that the boundary should be as follows: 'Beginning in the
     middle of the main channel of Mississippi River opposite the
     mouth of Des Moines River; thence up the said River Des
     Moines in the middle of the main channel thereof, to a point
     where it is intersected by the old Indian boundary line, or
     line run by John C. Sullivan in the year 1816; thence
     westwardly along said line to the old northwest corner of
     Missouri; thence due west to the middle of the main channel
     of Missouri River; thence up in the middle of the main
     channel of the river last mentioned to the mouth of Sioux or
     Calumet River; thence in a direct line to the middle of the
     main channel of St. Peter's River, where Watonwan River
     (according to Nicollet's map) enters the same; thence down
     the middle of the main channel of said river to the middle
     to the main channel of Mississippi River; thence down the
     middle of the main channel of said river to the place of
     beginning.'

     "An amendment was proposed in Congress which substituted the
     following in place of the boundary as given above:
     'Beginning in the middle of St. Peter's River, at the
     junction of Watonwan or Blue Earth River; with the said
     River St. Peter's running thence due east to the boundary
     line of the Territory of Wisconsin in the middle of
     Mississippi River; thence down the middle of the last-named
     river with the boundary line of the Territory of Wisconsin
     and state of Illinois to the northeast corner of the state
     of Missouri in the said River Mississippi; thence westwardly
     with the boundary line of said State of Missouri to a point
     due south from the place of beginning; thence due north to
     the place of beginning in said St. Peter's River.'

     "Of especial interest was the attitude taken by Samuel F.
     Vinton, representative from Ohio, in regard to the admission
     of Iowa. He believed that the Western States should be small
     in area in order that the West might not be deprived of its
     share in the government of the nation. It seemed to him that
     the policy so far pursued in the West had been wrong because
     the States were so large that they were sure to contain two
     or three times as large a population as the Atlantic States.
     There was at the time a provision under consideration that
     Florida might be divided, when either East or West Florida
     should contain a population of thirty-five thousand. Vinton
     contended that if Florida was to be divided, there should be
     a provision for dividing Iowa, because it was safer to give
     political power to the West than to the Atlantic States, for
     the West was the great conservative power of the Union. He
     stated that though the spirit of disunion might exist in the
     North and in the South, it could not live in the West,
     because the interests of the West were inseparably connected
     with both, and it would hold the two sections together,
     because it had no prejudice against either North or South
     and, what was of greater importance, the West was a grain
     growing country, and so must look equally to the
     manufacturing North and the cotton growing South for its
     market. Therefore the West must be conservative whether it
     wished to be or not. Vinton believed that instead of five
     there should have been at least twelve States in the old
     Northwest, and that to partly offset this injustice, small
     States should be formed west of the Mississippi. After
     considerable debate in the House, the bill for the admission
     of Iowa passed that body and was transmitted to the Senate,
     which it passed March 3, 1845.

     "After a vote for admission, the constitution was submitted
     to the people of Iowa, who made serious objections to it.
     One objection was directed against the small salaries to be
     paid, which, it was feared, would result in getting only
     inferior men for official positions. The restrictions on
     banks and corporations proved an unpopular feature. The
     limitation placed upon the extent of territory claimed by
     Iowa was unsatisfactory to many, though the State would
     still have an area of forty-four thousand three hundred
     square miles. This reduction of area was the greatest
     objection, so that when the vote was taken many who were in
     favor of statehood voted against forming a state of such
     reduced area, and the Constitution was rejected by a vote of
     seven thousand and nineteen to six thousand and
     twenty-three.

     "The governor called a special session of the legislature,
     and a bill for the re-submission of the constitution was
     passed over his veto. This was defeated by the people in
     August, 1845. On January 17, 1846, an Act was passed which
     provided for a new constitutional convention. This body came
     together in May and adopted a new constitution which did not
     differ greatly from the earlier instrument. The boundaries
     given in it were a compromise between those originally asked
     by the people and those granted by Congress. The matter was
     actively discussed in Congress when the new constitution
     with the changed boundaries came before that body, but the
     arguments were essentially the same as those previously
     advanced. An exciting campaign followed in Iowa, and the
     constitution was adopted, August 3, 1846, by a small
     majority. On the 4th of August the president signed the bill
     which settled the boundary question in accordance with the
     second constitution, and an Act was passed December 28,
     1846, by which Iowa was admitted into the Union."

CHAPTER IV

_Iowa and Her People_


"In all that is good Iowa affords the best."

Thus a few years ago wrote one of our state's most distinguished
citizens.[C]

And his utterance found a ready response in the hearts of the men and
women of our fair land, so that today the expression is an axiom. Every
Iowan believes firmly in its truth.

There is no fairer land under the benevolent sun. Here plenty reigns,
and prosperity has her home. Cheerful industry has redeemed the land
that once was the home of wild animals and untamed savages. Iowa's
waving corn fields; her meadows of luxuriant grass; her hills dotted
with magnificent houses and barns; her landscape made more picturesque
by the presence of fattening herds; her school houses and higher
centers of learning on almost every hill; the smoke from the busy
industries of her thriving cities and villages; her soil the most
fertile of any known; her waste land less than that of any other equal
area; her percentage of illiteracy the lowest; her mineral resources
abundant; her numerous streams affording water power inferior to
none--all these things and more rightly tend to make Iowans proud of
their State.

Now, as a half century ago, Iowa offers "to the lawloving and the
temperate; to the enterprising, the vigorous, the ambitious, a home and
a field worthy of their noblest efforts."[D] She throws open to the
world her exhaustless stores of wealth, her golden opportunities, and
says: "Behold your reward."

N. H. Parker, writing more than a half century ago, drew this glowing
picture of the future Iowa:

     "As the immigrant mother leads her sons and daughters into
     the undeveloped paths of wealth--as civilization elevates a
     race out of the sloughs of semi-barbarism--as national
     prosperity exalts a land--or as science raises the human
     intellect from darkness into dazzling light--thus Iowa, with
     rapid strides, ascends the precipitious sides of
     prosperity's mountain range, bearing her sons and daughters
     to loftier, and still loftier peaks, and revealing to their
     gaze still wider and richer vistas. And the summit of this
     range she will never reach; for her onward progress cannot
     be stayed, until her arterial streams are dry--until the
     agricultural life-blood in her veins has ceased to flow,
     until her great metallic heart has been emptied. Upon the
     topmost summit, then, Iowa will never stand, for through
     countless ages yet to come, her progress--that must be
     forever onward--must be upward also."[E]

The people of Iowa do not stand still. Not satisfied with present
achievements, they go forward, doing well to-day the tasks that
are theirs, and striving earnestly to make the future better and
more glorious than the past.

We can not do better here than by quoting a toast to the future of Iowa
given some years ago by O. J. Laylander, a loyal son of the state:

     "In the few minutes allotted to this toast scant justice may
     be awarded so worthy a theme. We love you, O Iowa, lusty
     child, resting in the mighty arms of the Missouri and the
     Father of Waters, laughing beneath the warm kisses and the
     love tears of gentle May; crying aloud to all the world:
     'See how I grow! How strong I am! How happy and healthy and
     beautiful!'

     "Iowa is glorious now. The great, green carpets, fresh from
     the springtime cleaning, shimmer in the glorious sun. The
     broad, black belts of loam await with open pockets the
     hiding of the golden grain. Living, glowing mines of gold
     stud the prairies' endless velvet folds. The countless
     castles of the farm are bound into great bundles by the
     sounding wire. Above every door that opens upon honest toil
     is inscribed in letters of gold the motto, 'Rich, rich,
     rich.'

     "Such is Iowa today in its wealth of land and stock. Each
     year the unfailing field fills the bins to bursting and
     grows the meat for millions.

     "Material Iowa, with great leaps, has gone forward in the
     world's race. Manifest destiny was misread by even the
     wisest of our grandfathers. Even thirty years ago no prophet
     dared choose the gorgeous hues necessary to a true picture
     of the Iowa of to-day.

     "Yet not alone in industrial lines has Iowa set the pace for
     the states. In politics she has crowded New England off the
     stage, and bold Ohio sits quietly at her feet. In literature
     and in arts she stands unashamed. Comfort and culture walk
     hand in hand, and happiness is a perennial contagion.

     "Some fifty years ago there came to Iowa a sturdy boy. Today
     he calls his own one thousand billowy acres which have risen
     in value in steps of ten until one hundred thousand dollars
     would not tempt him to yield his title. One June afternoon
     he sat on his piazza in sweet reverie. He reviewed the
     wonderful development of the grand old state, and sent his
     imagination in search of greater possibilities. From the
     hedge the thrush poured forth a song of love. The humming
     bees thrust their honeyed tongues into the flowers on the
     trellis at his side. The south wind was heavy with fragrance
     brushed from the blooming bushes. All nature conspired to
     steal the old man's senses and soon reverie gave way to
     sleep and dreams, and this, they say, was the dream: He
     dreamed that it was the year nineteen hundred and forty-one,
     and he was celebrating his hundredth birthday. He had seen
     comfort and culture become as common as the summer sun.
     Literature and art had countless country devotees. People
     had ceased to hurry, and worry was unknown: and then he
     dreamed that he died, and sought admission at the golden
     gate. To his amazement he was halted and informed that he
     was at the wrong place. Greatly grieved, he parleyed with
     the guard: 'I never wittingly did a human soul a wrong. I
     was rich, but it was not my fault. Why must I, who have
     always tried to do my duty, go to hell?' 'No one said
     anything about hell,' was the reply. 'To the annex--the
     second gate to the right. You Iowa people complain so much
     about celestial conditions and make so many comparisons with
     Iowa that we have concluded to colonize you a few thousand
     years and send you all back to Iowa.'

     "That the future of Iowa shall be such that if you shall not
     wish to come back, you shall at least wish to stay as long
     as possible, is my sincere desire."[F]

Calhoun made the assertion on the floor of the United States Senate
that he had been told that "the Iowa country has been seized upon by a
lawless body of armed men." Senator Ewing, of Ohio, and Senator Clay,
of Kentucky, had received similar information, the former asserting
that he would in no way object to giving each rascal who crossed the
Mississippi to the westward one thousand dollars if by that means he
might get rid of him. And these distinguished statesmen were not alone
in this view. To many in the east the first comers to the territory
were "land robbers," "idle and profligate characters," "fugitives from
justice," "lawless intruders," and worse. They were squatters "who
feared neither the laws of God nor man."

Doubtless those who made these assertions were honest and sincere. They
believed that only the most desperate characters, the outcasts of
decent communities, had the hardihood to explore this _terra
incognita_. They could not comprehend how persons living in settled
communities, and surrounded with many of the comforts of life, could be
so fool-hardy as to leave all these things for the sake of making a new
home in a wilderness inhabited only by wild animals and wilder and more
dangerous Indians.

But there is another side to the picture. Personal observation is
always more to be depended upon than hearsay testimony. One of the most
trust-worthy of the early writers on Iowa is Lieut. Albert Miller Lea.
He had spent some years in the "Ioway District"; he had made a tour of
observation across the state; he had most excellent opportunities for
observing and studying the character of our first settlers. His
testimony cannot be impeached, for he was a man far above the practice
of deceit. In his _Notes on the Wisconsin Territory_, particularly with
reference to the Iowa District or Black Hawk Purchase, published in
1836, he gives this vivid and truthful picture of our early
inhabitants:

     "The character of this population is such as is rarely to be
     found in our newly acquired territories. With very few
     exceptions, there is not a more orderly, industrious,
     active, pains-taking population west of the Alleghenies,
     than is this of the Iowa District. Those who have been
     accustomed to associate the name of _Squatter_ with the idea
     of idleness and recklessness, would be quite surprised to
     see the systematic manner in which every thing is here
     conducted. For intelligence, I boldly assert that they are
     not surpassed, as a body, by an equal number of citizens of
     any country in the world.

     "It is a matter of surprise that, about the Mining Region,
     there should be so little of the recklessness that is usual
     in that sort of life.... This regularity and propriety is to
     be attributed to the preponderance of well informed and
     well-intentioned gentlemen among them, as well as to the
     disposition of the mass of the people."[G]

Two years later another personal observer says: "He who supposes that
settlers ... who are now building upon, fencing and cultivating the
lands of the government are lawless depredators, devoid of the sense of
moral honesty, or that they are not in every sense as estimable
citizens, with as much intelligence, regard for law and social order,
for public justice and private rights ... as the farmers and yeomen of
New York and Pennsylvania ... has been led astray by vague and
unfounded notions, or by positively false information."[H]

These people knew the pioneers, and their testimony is entitled to
credence. As a class even the "Squatters" were not idle, or vicious, or
ignorant. They were young men, strong and hardy, full of courage and
adventure. "There was not a better population on the face of the
earth," is the testimony of Senator Benton. "They made roads," says
Prof. B. F. Shambaugh, superintendent of the Iowa State Historical
Society, "built bridges and mills, cleared the forests, broke the
prairies, erected houses and barns, and defended the settled country
against hostile Indians. They were distinguished especially for their
general intelligence, their hospitality, their independence and bold
enterprise. They had schools and school houses, erected churches, and
observed the Sabbath.... The pioneers were religious, but not
ecclesiastical. They lived in the open and looked upon the relations of
man to nature with an open mind. To be sure their thoughts were more on
'getting along' in this world than upon the 'immortal crown' of the
Puritan. And yet in the silent forest, in the broad prairie, in the
deep blue sky, in the sentinels of the night, in the sunshine and in
the storm, in the rosy dawn, in the golden sunset, and in the daily
trials and battles of frontier life, they too must have seen and felt
the Infinite."[I]

No greater tribute has ever been paid to the pioneers of our state than
that given by a distinguished native of the state, Hon. Robert G.
Cousins, on Iowa Day at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition at Omaha on
Sept. 21, 1898. The following extracts from that masterly oration are
worthy of preservation here:

     "I have asked five of the ablest and most noted Americans
     what they regard as the chief thing or leading feature of
     the Trans-Mississippi region and they have invariably
     answered, 'Its men and women.' The other day I met one of
     the oldest settlers of eastern Iowa--one of those original,
     rugged characters whose wit and wisdom have lightened the
     settlers' hearts and homes for many a toilsome year--one of
     those interesting characters who never bores you and whom
     one always likes to meet--a man whose head is silvered and
     whose countenance is kind--and I asked him what he regarded
     as the principal feature of our Trans-Mississippi country,
     and he replied: 'Well, I'm no scholar, but I've been round
     here nigh onto sixty years and I reckon 'bout the most
     important thing is the folks and the farms.'

     "Iowa became a separate territory, with the capital at
     Burlington, in 1838, and was admitted into the Union in
     1846, and has been in it ever since. It makes little
     difference whether it was first settled by the whites at
     Dubuque for mining purposes in 1788, or, for trading
     purposes, at Montrose, in 1799, or opposite Prairie du
     Chien, in 1804 or 5, or in Lee county at Sandusky in 1820,
     or on the lower rapids at what is now known as Nashville, in
     1829; or whether the first settlements for general purposes
     were made at Burlington and Davenport in 1832. The main fact
     is that it was well settled--not by dyspeptic tourists nor
     by invalids who had come west out of curiosity and New
     Jersey, nor by climate seeking dilettanti with two servants
     and one lung--but by the best bone and sinew of the middle
     states, New England and the old world. I do not know that
     there were any dukes or lords or marquises or duchesses, but
     there were Dutch and Irish and Scotch and Scotch-Irish and
     English and Americans, and they had home rule right from the
     start--at least they had it in the first school which I
     attended. The men and women who settled the Hawkeye state
     were not those who expected to go back 'in the fall,' or as
     soon as they could prove up on their claims. They were
     stayers. They were not men to be discouraged by winter or by
     work. They were men who knew that nobody ever amounted to
     much in this world unless he had to. Most of them began
     simply with the capital of honesty, good health and their
     inherent qualities of character. They built their cabins in
     the clearings and, watching the smoke curl up in the great,
     wide sky, felt just as patriotic for their humble rustic
     homes as e'er did princes for their castles or millionaires
     for mansions grand.

     "To build a home is a great thing. It doesn't matter so much
     about the dimensions. 'Kings have lived in cottages and
     pygmies dwelt in palaces,' but the walls of a home always
     add something to inherent character. In the formation of
     character there are always two elements, the inherent and
     the adventitious--that which we bring with us into the world
     and that which our surroundings give us. Somebody said
     'there is only a small portion of the earth that produces
     splendid people.' Our pioneers got into a good place. They
     had left doubt sitting on a boulder in the east and packed
     their things and started for the west. Rivers had to be
     forded, trees to be felled, cabins had to be built--the
     rifle must be kept loaded--so much the better, there was
     self-reliance. Corn and coffee had to be ground, and on the
     same mill--so much the better, there was ingenuity. Teeth
     had to be filled, and there was no painless dentistry.
     Disease and injury must be dealt with, and the doctor fifty
     miles away. Life must be lightened, lonely hearts must be
     cheered, and the old friends and comrades far back in the
     states or maybe away in fatherland, and the cheering letter
     tarrying with the belated stage coach--hold fast, thou
     sturdy denizen and gentle helpmate of the rich and wondrous
     empire, infinite goodness guards thee and the fertile fields
     are ready to reward.

CARROLL'S HISTORY]

     "Ah, pampered people of the later generations, when you
     imagine modern hardships, think of the courage and the
     trials and the ingenuity of pioneers when there were no
     conveniences but the forest and the axe, the wide rolling
     prairie and the ox team, the great blue sky, the unsolved
     future and the annual ague! Complain of markets in these
     modern times and then think of your grandmother when she was
     a blooming bride, listening through the toilsome days and
     anxious nights for the wagon bringing home the husband from
     a distant market with calico and jeans purchased with
     dressed pork sold at a dollar and a half a hundred, and
     maybe bringing home a little money, worth far less per yard
     than either calico or jeans. Maybe it is all for the best,
     human character was being formed for the development of a
     great and loyal and progressive state to shine forever among
     the stars of the federal union....

     "Civil government in Iowa proceeded with its rapid
     settlement. The pioneer became a model citizen. He knew the
     necessity for the laws that were enacted. He did not feel
     oppressed by government. He had experienced the losses of
     robbery and larceny and knew something of the embarrassment
     and inconvenience of being scalped. There was no hysteria
     about trusts and combines because they had practiced
     combinations themselves for mutual protection. If any one
     would learn the true genius and exemplification and
     philosophy of self-government, government of and for and by
     the people, let him study the records of pioneer life, the
     institutional beginnings, and the evolution of their laws.
     It would be worth our while on some suitable occasion when
     time permitted to talk over the interesting incidents
     attending the administration of justice in the early days of
     Iowa, the incidents of its territorial legislatures, the
     birth and growth of its statehood and the character of its
     officials. But the greatness of our state is not contained
     in any name. Its official history is the exponent of its
     industrial life and character. Its greatness is the sum
     total of its citizenship. In order to be just, John Jones,
     the average citizen, must be mentioned along with our most
     illustrious officials. Somebody said that the history of a
     nation is the history of its great men, but there is an
     unwritten history which that averment overlooks. The growth
     of a state is the progress of its average citizen. The
     credit of a commonwealth is the thrift of its John Jones and
     its William Smith, and the character, prosperity and
     patriotism of the individual citizen is the history of Iowa.

     "The population of 97,000 which she had when admitted into
     the union had increased to 754,699 at the close of the Civil
     war. Of these about 70,000, almost one-tenth of the
     population, were in the war--a number equal to nearly
     one-half of the voters of the state. Who made the history of
     Iowa during that great struggle of our nation's life? John
     Jones, the average citizen, whether he carried a musket
     helping to put the scattered stars of state back into the
     constellation of the Union, or whether he toiled from early
     dawn to lingering twilight in the fields or in the shop. The
     best civilization is that which maintains the highest
     standard of life for its average citizen.

     "Since the Civil war the state of Iowa has increased in
     population to almost 2,225,000 of people, and most of the
     time has had the least illiteracy of any state in the Union.
     Doubtless for that we are indebted to many of the older
     states, whose enterprising and courageous citizens
     constitute so large a portion of our population. With but a
     century of statehood and with an area of but 55,475 square
     miles, the state of Iowa produces the greatest quantity of
     cereals of any state in the Union. As long ago as the last
     federal census, taken in 1890, it produced more corn, more
     oats, more beef, more pork than any state in the Union. Not
     long since I was introduced to a gentleman from New York
     city. He said, 'Oh, from Iowa--ah--let me see, that's
     out--ah--you see, I'm not very well posted on the geography
     of the west.' 'Yes,' I said, 'it's out there just across the
     Mississippi river. You can leave New York about noon and get
     your supper in Iowa the next evening. It might be worth your
     while to look it up. It's the state which produces more of
     the things which people eat than any other state in the
     Union. It has more miles of railroads than your state of New
     York, more than Mexico, more than Brazil and more than all
     the New England states combined.'

     "The value of Iowa's agricultural products and live stock in
     round numbers for the year 1892 was $407,000,000, to say
     nothing of her other great and various industries and
     enterprises. She produced that year 160,000,000 pounds of
     the best butter on earth of the value of $32,000,000. The
     Hawkeye butter ladle has achieved a cunning that challenges
     all Columbia. The Iowa cow has slowly and painfully yet
     gradually and grandly worked her way upward to a shining
     eminence in the eyes of the world. The state of Iowa has on
     her soil today, if nothing ill befalls it, ninety million
     dollars' worth of corn. The permanent value of land is
     estimated by its corn-producing qualities. Of all the
     products of the earth, corn is king and it reigns in Iowa.

     "Industry and nature have made the state of Iowa a creditor.
     Her soil has always been solvent and her system of farming
     does not tend to pauperize. She is a constant seller and
     therefore wants the evidence of the transaction to be
     unimpeachable. She has more school teachers than any other
     state except the Empire state and only three and six-tenths
     per cent of her population are illiterates. The state of
     Iowa has yielded the greatest dividends on her educational
     investments. She has become illustrious on account of her
     enlightenment. She has progressed further from 'primitive
     indifferent tissue' than the land even of Darwin himself,
     and in her escape from protoplasm and prejudice she is
     practically out of danger. Marked out in the beginning by
     the hand of God, bounded on the east and west by the two
     great rivers of the continent, purified and stimulated by
     the snows of winter, blessed with copious rainfall in the
     growing season, with generous soil and stately forests
     interspersed, no wonder that the dusky aborigines exclaimed
     when they crossed the Father of Waters, 'Iowa, this is the
     place!' Not only did the red men give our state its
     beautiful and poetic name, but Indian nomenclature runs like
     a romance throughout the counties and communities. What
     infinite meaning, what tokens of joy and sadness, of triumph
     and of tears, of valor and of vanquishment, of life and love
     and song there may be in these weird, strange words that
     name to-day so many of our towns and streams and counties:
     Allamakee, Chickasaw, Dakota City, Sioux, Pocahontas,
     Winneshiek, Keosauqua, Sac, Winnebago, Tama, Nodawa,
     Competine, Chariton, Comanche, Cherokee, Waukon,
     Muchakinock, Washta, Monona, Waupeton, Onawa, Keota,
     Waudina, Ioka, Ottumwa, Oneska, Waukee, Waucoma,

     Quasqueton, Anamosa, Poweshiek, Pottawattamie, Osceola,
     Oskaloosa, Wapsipinicon.

     "Ere long some westland genius, moved by the mystic
     inspiration of the rich and wondrous heritage of Iowa
     nativity, may sing the song of our legends and traditions,
     may voice in verse the wondrous story of his illustrious
     state. Maybe somewhere among the humble homes where blood
     and bone and brain grow pure and strong, where simple food
     with frugal ways feeds wondering minds and drives them
     craving into nature's secrets and her songs--somewhere along
     the settler's pathway or by the Indian trail where now the
     country churchyards grown with uncut grasses hide the forms
     of sturdy ancestors sleeping all in peaceful ignorance of
     wayward sons or wondrous progeny--somewhere where rising sun
     beholds the peasantry at early toil and leaves them in the
     mystic twilight ere their tasks are done, where odors of the
     corn and new-mown hay and vine-clad hedges by the shadowy
     roadside linger long into the night-time, as a sweet and
     sacred balm for tired hearts--somewhere, sometime the song
     of Iowa shall rise and live, and it will not omit the
     thought of that gifted son who said: 'Iowa, the affections
     of her people, like the rivers of her borders, flow to an
     inseparable union.'"




CHAPTER V

_The Geology of Linn County_

BY WILLIAM HARMON NORTON, PROFESSOR OF GEOLOGY IN CORNELL COLLEGE


It is said that a certain county in Kentucky, underlain by limestone,
always goes democratic; while a county adjacent, underlain by
sandstone, is as invariably republican. Certain it is that a deal of
politics, economics, and history depends at last analysis more or less
upon the processes past and present which belong to geology and
physiography. The rocks, the minerals they contain, and the water they
store, the hills and valleys into which they have been carved, and the
soils to which they weather, largely control the industries, locate the
cities, and outcrop even in the social, intellectual, and moral life of
the people. The metropolis of Linn county, for example, owes its name
and place to the rapids of the Cedar, and the rapids find ultimate
cause in the fact that some millions of years ago nature stopped laying
a softer rock upon the ocean bed and deposited upon it one of more
resistant texture. In the eastern part of the county the Chicago &
Northwestern Railway runs for very good and sufficient reasons where
once rested the edge of a long tongue of glacial ice, and west of Cedar
Rapids its route is determined by the course taken by the turbid floods
issuing from the melting glaciers. The streets of Mount Vernon and
several of the main highways of the county do not lie with the points
of the compass but follow the direction of flow of ancient ice-streams.
The distribution of forest and prairie is due to geologic causes. The
values of farm lands are markedly affected by the same influences, and
we can even point out a little area which differs from its surroundings
in its inhabitants and in their literacy, language, architecture,
manners, and morals, primarily because it belongs to what geologists
classify as the deeply dissected loess-covered Kansan drift sheet.

The inductive history of Linn county, reasoned out from what we have
learned of the lie of the land, the shapes of hills and valleys, the
soils and subsoils, and the underlying rocks, is a wonderfully long
one. The first chapter that has been opened to inspection in the
geologic record of our area is that of the deepest rocks probed by the
first deep well drilled at Cedar Rapids. At a depth of 2,150 feet from
the surface--1,417 feet below the level of the sea--the drill
encountered a hard red siliceous rock which may be taken as the
equivalent of the _Sioux Quartzite_, which comes to the surface at
Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and at Baraboo, Wisconsin. This well known
building stone is used in a number of the business blocks and private
residences of Cedar Rapids, as for example in the old office building
of the _Republican_. Belonging to the Algonkian, an era so remote that
its age must be reckoned in scores if not in hundreds of millions of
years, the quartzite at the bottom of the deep well tells of time
inconceivably remote when Linn county was part of a wide sea floor on
which red sands were washed to and fro and finally laid to rest in
thick deposits of sandstone. Tilted and folded and hardened by
pressure, the Algonkian rocks were uplifted from the sea to form dry
land of mountainous heights. After the lapse of ages the old land sunk
beneath the sea, and again and again with intervals of uplift and
subaerial erosion there were laid upon it sea muds, impure limestones,
and thick sandstones during a long succession of geologic aeons.
Samples of these deposits can be seen in the well drillings preserved
in the Y. M. C. A. at Cedar Rapids and in the collections of Cornell
College. For many millions of years Linn county was thus sometimes land
and sometimes sea, but neither land nor sea was tenanted by aught but
the humblest of living creatures. These ancient deposits concern us
because they are the aqueducts by which artesian waters of purest
quality are brought to our doors from their sources far to the
northward in other states.

[Illustration: PALISADES]

The most recent of the formations which are pierced by the drill, but
which do not come to the surface within the limits of the county, is
the _Maquoketa shale_, reached in the eastern townships at a depth of
somewhat more than 300 feet. This impervious bed of altered clay stops
the descent of ground water, which thus is stored in large quantities
in the overlying limestones and supplies some of the important wells of
the county such as that of the town of Mount Vernon. At the time when
these sea clays were laid, eastern Iowa was under sea, but so near was
the low lying land to the north and east that vast quantities of mud
were brought in by its rivers forming deposits nearly 300 feet in
thickness.


THE SILURIAN

With the lapse of ages physical conditions changed and Linn County was
covered with a warm shallow coral sea in which were laid the massive
limestones which now form the country rock in the eastern tier of
townships. In some of the quarries one may see the ripple marks into
which these coral sands were heaped by the pulse of the waves, and one
may pick out of the rocks casts and moulds of ancient sea shells,
corals, and trilobites, which formed the highest forms of life then
tenanting the Iowa seas.

The lowest beds of the Silurian belong to the _Hopkinton stage_, and
are exposed along the Buffalo. At Hill's mill and at Nugent's quarries
some layers are crowded with a characteristic fossil--a plump bivalve
shell as large as a walnut, which goes by the name of _Pentamerus
Oblongus_. The _Gower_ stage of the Silurian rests upon the Hopkinton
and embraces two types of rocks distinct in their appearance and uses.
The _LeClaire phase_ of the Gower is a hard, brittle, crystalline,
magnesian limestone, or dolomite. Normally blue-gray in color, it is
often oxidised to buff. It is well exposed at Viola and on the Cedar
river from the Cedar County line to a mile or so beyond the Upper
Palisades, southwest of Bertram. The LeClaire forms mounds in places
reaching fifty and even eighty or ninety feet in height in which little
semblance of bedding structures are to be seen. Here and there the rock
is conglomeratic, consisting of rounded masses of the rock cemented by
a less resistent matrix. The cavernous recess in the rock wall of the
Palisades, misnamed the Blowout, is due to the solution of the weaker
matrix and the dislodgement of the rounded masses. The rock may consist
also of angular broken blue-gray fragments in the matrix of a buff and
friable limestone sand. Again, the mounds, at least in part, may be
made up of massive limestone with little trace of structure of any
sort. On the sides of the mounds and merging into the conglomeratic or
other structures the rock of the LeClaire often is stratified and the
layers dip outward at angles surprisingly high. In places these tilted
layers may show sharp folds. The rock of all structures is
fossiliferous. Even the broken fragments of breccia are porous with
moulds of minute fossils which have been removed by solution. The
massive rock is largely made up in places of stems of crinoids--stone
lilies which grew in the greatest profusion in these quiet waters--and
the tilted layers may be made of casts and moulds of unbroken shells of
little bivalves. Occasionally the saucer shaped tail and head-shields
of a characteristic trilobite are found piled together and unbroken.
Coral are very common in this ancient reef rock, a form resembling
honeycomb being especially noticeable. And as one floats down stream
at the base of the cliffs he can hardly fail to notice large tapering
segmented shells, either straight or slightly curved, representatives
of the cephalopod mollusks.

The picturesque rock walls of the Palisades, which rise perpendicular
for as much as ninety feet from the water's edge, are due primarily to
the great resistance of the LeClaire rock, due to its chemical
composition--for dolomite weathers far less rapidly than a
non-magnesian limestone--and to the fewness of those planes of weakness
called joint-planes. The joints of the LeClaire are distant and
vertical. The stone breaks down, therefore, in immense blocks where
undercut by the river which leave for ages the scarp behind them as a
vertical wall.

Because of its qualities the LeClaire is one of the best lime rocks in
the country. The impurities of the clay, the iron and silica which it
contains, may run as low as one-third of one per cent. The large per
cent of carbonate of magnesia present makes it a cool lime, slow to
slack and slow to set, and it is to such limes that architects, masons,
and plasterers now invariably give preference over the so-called hot
limes burned from non-magnesian limestones. The hardness and durability
of mortars made from the LeClaire rock limes approaches that of cement,
and after thirty-five or forty years of weathering, joints in mason
work seem almost as fresh as when first struck.

The extreme hardness of the rock and the slowness with which it
weathers make it specially valuable for crushing for macadam and
ballast.

The _Anamosa phase_ of the Gower limestone is typically exposed in the
large quarries at Anamosa and Stone City, Mount Vernon and Waubeek. It
is a light buff or yellow limestone, with constant, parallel, and
horizontal or gently inclined laminated layers. The limestone is soft
to work but hardens on exposure. The saw encounters no obdurate
materials and the chisel finds the fracture even and regular. Bedding
planes are so even and smooth as to be at once ready for the mortar
with little or no dressing. Much of the stone can be split horizontally
to any desired thickness, while the distant joints permit the quarrying
of blocks beyond the facilities of transportation or any possible use.
Many layers are so homogenous that they can be wrought into fine
carvings.

As a dolomite the stone is far more resistant than a purer limestone.
In the Mount Vernon cemetery tombstones of this material, whose dates
run back to the forties and early fifties, have been so little affected
by superficial decay that the tool marks are almost as fresh as when
the chisel left them; while marbles of half their age have broken down
into ruin.

The Silurian rocks of the county measure about 300 feet in thickness.
They are confined pretty closely to the townships of the eastern tier,
but extend beyond their limits up the valleys of the Cedar and
Wapsipinicon.


THE BERTRAM LIMESTONE

As the Silurian limestones sink below the surface because of the
westward dip, they are succeeded by a bed of rock, named from its
outcrop at Bertram, and found along Big Creek as far north as Paralta
and Springville. This is a heavily bedded gray rock which weathers
almost white. At a number of places along Big Creek it forms
picturesque cliffs, and hillsides covered with huge boulders of
disintegration. At one point it is seen to overlie the Anamosa beds of
the Silurian, and several exposures are known where it is succeeded by
the Otis limestones of the Devonian. But as it contains no fossils, so
far as is now known, it can not be said to which of the two ages it
belongs.


THE OTIS LIMESTONES

The lower beds of the Otis, as exposed at the base of the Otis
quarries, along the Cedar south of Cedar Rapids, at Springville, and at
Coggon, consist of soft magnesian limestones, fossiliferous with many
moulds of small bivalve shells of Devonian age. These pass upward into
drab non-magnesian limestones carrying the principal fossil of the
magnesian beds in considerable numbers. The upper limestones of the
Otis differ within rather wide limits. The most common type is seen at
the base of the high cliff at Kenwood on the right bank of Indian
Creek--a hard, brittle ringing and thinly laminated limestone. Often it
has been subjected to strains under which it has broken, and has been
re-cemented with little displacement of the parts. Occasionally it is
brown, and highly crystalline.


THE INDEPENDENCE

At the Kenwood cliff the eight feet of the Otis at the base is
succeeded by thirty feet of buff shale and clayey limestones--a
formation known as the _Independence_ from its discovery in a shaft
sunk at that city. The Independence is exposed at many points near
Cedar Rapids both on Indian Creek and on the Cedar. On the Wapsipinicon
it is well seen at Cedar Bluff (sec. 24 Spring Grove Tp.), at the
"Wolf's Den" a mile up valley, and again in the railway cut north of
Coggon. In the long cut of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway
west of Linn Junction the Independence is seen in one place as a blue
clay shale carrying a number of fossils characteristic of the shaft at
Independence, but elsewhere the formation is unfossiliferous in the
natural exposures so far studied.

Wherever found the Independence contains nodules of silica, which may
reach a foot in diameter, and often angular fragments of the same
material which may be as fine as sand. The formation is marked by
irregularities of deposition, channel cutting by drift currents, lenses
of calcerous material, and rapid lateral change in the form and
constituents of the rock. All of these characteristics point to the
deposition of this formation in a shallow sea near shore.

Indeed, some of the beds were apparently laid in marshes such as are
now found along low ocean shores. Thin seams of coal formed in the
Independence were once peaty deposits preserved by the presence of
water from the decay which returns dead vegetable matter to the air. In
1871 such a seam of coal, not exceeding an inch in thickness, was found
at a depth of ninety feet in a well on the farm of Mrs. C. Hemphill,
near LaFayette. Pieces of the coal were taken to Cedar Rapids and
Marion. A mining company was formed, and without seeking for any expert
advice from geologist or mining engineer, and without any tests of the
extent and thickness of the seam, a shaft was sunk after the precious
fuel. Water was encountered in such quantities that expensive pumping
machinery was used, and in all several thousand dollars were wasted in
a search which any competent geologist could have told was foredoomed
to failure.


THE DAVENPORT LIMESTONES

The sea over eastern Iowa deepened after the deposition of the
Independence, for there was now deposited upon its floor limestones in
place of shales. The lowest of these, known as the _lower Davenport_
beds, are hard, compact, and of finest grain, and so far as known are
unfossiliferous. The _upper Davenport_ is a tough, gray,
semi-crystalline limestone which contains an assemblage of fossils of
many species. Highest of these are the first vertebrates to appear in
Iowa so far as our records go. Fishes which swam over our area left to
be imbedded in the limestones their hard enameled teeth and fin spines.
The most common of the Devonian fishes was a small shark.

In several other counties the lower and the upper Davenport limestones
retain the attitude of their deposition. But everywhere in Linn county
they have been broken into bits and re-cemented, forming breccia. These
brittle rocks could hardly give way to such immense stresses without
causing sharp and violent vibrations to run through the crust of the
earth, and we may therefore list great earthquakes as a part of the
history of our area in Devonian times.

The best exposure of the breccia beds is that of the cut of the
Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway west of Linn Junction. The
brittle lower Davenport has here been broken and rebroken into a mass
of small sharp-edged fragments, while the tough heavily bedded upper
Davenport ledges have been fractured to large blocks, which sliding on
each other have smoothed and grooved their sides. The breccia beds may
be seen in the upper eleven feet of the Kenwood cliff, at Troy Mills,
and in the cliffs along the Wapsipinicon valley as far down as near to
Central City.


THE CEDAR VALLEY LIMESTONES

The Otis, Independence, and Davenport limestones form a group called
the Wapsipinicon, from its outcrop along the river of that name in Linn
county. The remaining limestones of the Devonian are grouped together
under the name of the Cedar Valley. These consist of limestones of
various types, sometimes crowded with fossils, and sometimes destitute
of any trace of ancient life. They occupy the western townships of the
county.


THE CARBONIFEROUS

At the close of the Cedar Valley stage the sea retreated westward from
our area, and Linn county became dry land. For long ages its rocks were
covered with rich soils supporting a luxuriant vegetation, probably
tropical in its aspect. We know that running water channelled this
ancient land, for when at last in _Pennsylvanian_ (Coal measure) time
the land sunk slowly beneath the sea, there were deposited in such
channels clays and sandstones, which perhaps are only remnants of wide
sheets of similar deposits now removed by denudation. A mile and a half
south of Marion (southeast quarter of section 12, Rapids township) a
well twenty-three feet deep penetrated a bed of dark shale which
carried leaf impressions of a number of ferns characteristic of the
undergrowth of the Carboniferous forests. A third of a mile southeast
of Lisbon, and again about two miles south of the same village, at
Bertram at the east end of the railway bridge, and on the old county
road between Cedar Rapids and Marion, are exposures of sandstone which
in some instances contain fragments of the logs drifted from perhaps
distant uplands and water-logged and sunk in these ancient sand beds.
The Bertram outlier contains many rolled coral fragments and worn bits
of shells of the Devonian, included in Carboniferous deposits, much as
the same fossils may now be found in the river deposits of the present
age in the sand bars of the Cedar.


MESOZOIC AND TERTIARY

For a succession of geologic ages our county, in common with eastern
Iowa, seems to have remained dry land, for no deposits of the sea are
found upon it. On both sides of the continent mountain ranges of Alpine
height were uplifted, and during the immeasurable years worn down,
grain by grain, to flat and featureless plains. But no deformations are
recorded in our county history and the lands seems to have remained so
low that little erosion was possible. We are permitted to conceive that
over our savannas in Mesozoic times there roamed monstrous reptiles of
strange shapes, such as are known to have existed in adjacent states.
In the later ages of this era it is not impossible that during the
great submergence which brought the Cretaceous sea over the Great
Plains from the Arctic to the Gulf, including western Iowa, our area
also may have been inundated and huge swimming reptiles such as are
found in the deposits of Kansas and Nebraska may have disported
themselves where now our rich farm lands lie open to the sun, while in
the air featherless cold-blooded creatures larger than any bird winged
their way on leathery pinions.

[Illustration: THE ASTOR HOUSE Erected by John Young in 1839, Looking
South The Second House in Cedar Rapids COURTESY CARROLL'S HISTORY]

During the millions of years which are included in the Tertiary ages
Linn county was undoubtedly dry land. On our grass lands pastured a
succession of strange and uncouth mammals evolving into higher and
higher forms. Among these denizens of the county were probably herds of
pig-like creatures, three toed horses little bigger than foxes, and
ancestral monkeys swarming in the trees, for such are known to have
existed in other states. But these chapters in the history of the
county can not be written from any local records.


THE GLACIAL EPOCH

The warm climate of Tertiary times changed slowly to one of arctic
cold. The winters lengthened and the summers becoming ever cooler and
yet cooler failed at last to melt the winter snows. Vast sheets of
glacial ice, such as that which shrouds Greenland today, covered much
of the continent. The geologic panorama thus presents our area as
buried beneath one after another of slow-moving glaciers hundreds of
feet thick. The proofs of their existence are found in almost every
cutting which goes below the soil. Any quarry will show the rock deeply
rotted and pitted by long preglacial decay. Here and there upon its
surface will be found remnants of the deep red residual clays, the
subsoils of preglacial times. Upon these clays formed from the decaying
rock rest stony clays in which clay, sand, and stones faceted as only
glacier ice can facet, are mingled pell-mell together, as only glacier
ice can mingle. Occasionally is found the unmistakable track of the
glacier left on the underlying rock scraped smooth and marked with
parallel scorings, as at the north end of the cut of the Chicago,
Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway at Linn Junction.

The glaciers also brought from ledges of granite and other crystalline
rocks in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Canada the boulders which form a
conspicuous feature in some of our prairie landscapes. These, the
"first settlers," traveled to their destinations far more leisurely
than any ox carts of the immigrant pioneers; for the glaciers can not
have moved faster at most than fifty feet a day, and probably at less
than a tenth that rate, judging by the rates of motion of present
glaciers.

The ice sheets of the glacial epoch plastered the county thick with the
stony clays which they dragged along in their basal layers. The
thickness of these glacial deposits probably averages from fifty to one
hundred feet. Old valleys cut in rock by Tertiary rivers were buried
wholly from view, as, for example, one extending north from
Prairieburg; and the farmer now plows his corn in fields which lie two
and three hundred feet above the channels of ancient rivers. In places
the old valleys were left to be re-occupied by the rivers. Such are the
reaches of wide valley of the Cedar south of Center Point. In other
places the rivers were diverted wholly from their ancient beds and made
to flow in new channels which they have not yet had time to widen and
deepen to their ancient measures. Such are the narrow rock bound
valleys of the Wapsipinicon south of Troy Mills and of the Cedar at the
Palisades.

On the final retreat of the glaciers waters from the melting ice swept
over the county, leaving deposits of sand on the lower lands and in the
valleys. Since the glacial epoch the rivers have cut their beds a score
of feet and more below the deposits of glacial floods and in many
places, as near the Ivanhoe bridge, remnants of these ancient flood
plains are left as terraces or "benches" or "second bottoms." At
Bertram the sands deposited by glacial waters near the mouth of Big
Creek stand about fifty feet above the level of the river.


THE LOESS

A large part of the county is covered with a deposit of fine yellow
silt called loess. Dry, it crumbles into powder at a finger touch; wet,
it is somewhat plastic and can be moulded into brick and tile. On the
hill and uplands the loess is thickly spread, adding in places at least
forty feet to their elevation. Over the lowlands it is thin or absent.
This yellow earth has been and is to be of greater value than mines of
yellow gold. It is of inexhaustible fertility. It contains abundant
mineral plant foods, partly constituent, and partly brought up into it
by ground water; and these foods are so finely pulverized as to be of
readiest solution and absorption by the roots. In wet weather the loess
mantle absorbs the rainfall like a sponge; in months of desert drouth,
like those of the summer of 1910, it returns the water to the surface,
like a wick, to preserve the crops from failure.

A disadvantage of the loess lies in the readiness with which it washes.
The forest which once covered nearly all the uplands protected the soil
from wash by means of its mattress of roots and the thick prairie sod
was equally efficient where hill slopes were grassed over. But where
forests have been thoughtlessly cut down, and steep slopes turned to
plow land, it is but a few years until the brown top-soil is all washed
away and the fields in spring when freshly plowed are as yellow as a
deep cut in road or brick yard. The foot path in the pasture or the
furrow of the plow becomes a gully in a single heavy rain, and unless
checked soon becomes a gulch scores of feet in width.

By accenting the height of the ridges the loess also adds to the
scenery of the county. Our area lies in a part of east central Iowa
where the stony clays deposited by ancient glaciers accumulated in long
ridges and belts of upland rising many feet above the intervening
undulating plains. Because of the alternation of ridge and lowland no
part of the state except the valley of the Upper Mississippi has so
beautiful and wide and varied prospects. Over more or less of their
course the rivers of the county have cut their channels lengthwise in
the ridges, thus giving rise to the bold scenery of the Wapsipinicon
above Central City, and of the Cedar near Mount Vernon. Some of these
picturesque reaches of river and cliff and forest slope should surely
be converted into county parks in the near future and preserved for the
gratification of all coming generations. Unless this is done we may
expect that the forests will be cut down and the hill slopes gashed
with countless gullies; while the lichened rocks of the river cliffs
fringed with fern and tamarisk will give place to unsightly quarries.

While Linn county was sheeted with glacier ice, no life of any sort was
possible within its limits. But during the long interglacial epochs
which intervened between the ice invasions, forests grew and animals
now extinct roamed over our hills and plains. Among these early
inhabitants may be mentioned extinct horses and the giant
proboscidians, the mammoth, and the mastodon. These returned to the
area after the final retreat of the ice and their remains are found in
the peat bogs and river gravels. In the earliest of the interglacial
epochs it is quite probable that some of the gigantic groundsloths of
South America made their home here, since they are known to have done
so in the western counties of the state. No traces of man have been
found in the glacial deposits of Iowa, nor have any indubitable
evidences of his presence in glacial times been found in North America.
Sometime, we know not when, roving tribes of Indians set foot within
our area, and geology gives place to archeology. And when the white man
appeared, inductive history ends and there begins the history of
tradition and written records.




CHAPTER VI

_Beginnings in Linn County_


The Black Hawk war, though confined to the state of Illinois, made an
epoch in the history of Iowa. It was the last of the many Indian wars,
and was concluded by a cession of much of the valuable lands of Iowa to
the government. Reports of the war had stirred up more or less
enthusiasm as to the future of the west, and settlers began to come
soon after the war had ended. Many of the officers, and others who had
taken part in the war, became the government agents and officials in
various capacities in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa. The government
also, through its representatives in congress, planned great things for
the west in opening canals and roads, while rivers were made navigable
and steamship traffic opened up.

One must not be led to believe that Iowa was the only part of the west
which grew so rapidly. The growth was general, it is true, but Iowa
seems to have grown more rapidly than any other of the territories
between 1836 and 1846.

Illinois was admitted as a state in 1818; Missouri three years later;
next came Iowa in 1846, while Wisconsin, which had been explored in
1639, was not admitted to statehood till 1848; and Minnesota, settled
as early as 1680, and having a fort built in 1820, was not admitted to
statehood till 1858. Thus, it would appear, that Iowa remained a
territory for a shorter period of time than any other of the western
states located in the Mississippi valley, but, of course, there is
reason for this. It was a prairie state, in the first instance, and on
the east was bounded by a great waterway and by a state teeming with an
aggressive population, many of whose people soon crossed the borderland
even before the government had made proper surveys and thrown the land
open to settlement.

Henry Dodge was appointed governor of the new Territory of Wisconsin in
1836, Iowa at that time being a part of Wisconsin. With the exception
of a few settlements of white people along Lake Michigan and in the
mining region around Dubuque there were few, if any, white settlers.
Governor Dodge's work was largely with the Indians, in making contracts
and ceding lands to the government. Settlers were coming in constantly
and a demand for a survey of the lands was made from time to time.
Survey of the public lands in Iowa was begun in the fall of 1836. Great
preparations for the land sales were made. These were to take place in
Dubuque and Burlington in November, 1838. The settlers who had arrived
on these lands for some time prior to its survey arranged among
themselves to select an arbitration association, each township making a
register of all claims, and choosing one representative to attend the
land sales, giving him authority to bid off the lands selected by each
claimant.

A. C. Dodge was appointed the first registrar of the land office at
Burlington, and George W. Jones the first surveyor-general of Iowa. One
of the surveyors-general in the early '40s was no other than Judge
James Wilson, of Keene, New Hampshire, a son of a Revolutionary
soldier, and himself a lawyer of more than ordinary ability, a judge,
and at one time a member of congress. He was appointed by General
Harrison, an old friend.

At the first convention which met at Burlington in November, 1837, for
the purpose of organizing a separate territory of Iowa, were the
following delegates from Dubuque county, which, at that time, included
a part of what later became Linn county: P. H. Engle, J. I. Fales, G.
W. Harris, W. A. Warren, W. B. Watts, A. F. Russell, W. H. Patton, J.
W. Parker, J. D. Bell and J. H. Rose. The convention in its petition to
congress asserted that there were 25,000 people in that portion of
Wisconsin Territory known as "The Iowa District;" that houses had been
erected; that farms were cultivated, and still people could not obtain
title to their lands, and asking that the part west of the river be set
aside as a separate territory. This was one of the most important
conventions held on what became Iowa soil, and congress at once took
action to make such provisions as were thought wise and expedient.

Linn county was established by an act of the legislature of the
Territory of Wisconsin approved on December 21, 1837. The county was
regular in shape, but four townships larger than its neighbors on the
north and east, which were created at the same time. The boundaries
received at this time have not been altered. The spelling of the name
was Lynn, although it was spelled in the body of the act itself Linn;
it took its name from Dr. Louis F. Linn, United States senator from
Missouri, who was appointed to that office in 1833 and who was a friend
and admirer of President Jackson, and much interested in the
development of the west.

The eastern part of Linn county, perhaps one-third, had been part of
the original county of Dubuque since 1834, the boundary line running
from the southeast corner of the county in a northwesterly line a
little to the west of the middle in the northern part of the county.
Linn county then embraces within its limits two Indian land cessions.
The eastern part was acquired from the Sac and Fox Indians by the
treaty of September 21, 1832, known as the Black Hawk Purchase; the
western part, or the other two-thirds, was acquired by treaty of
October 21, 1837. The fourteen counties created by an act sub-dividing
Dubuque county into new counties, which was approved October 21, 1837,
were as follows: Dubuque, Clayton, Jackson, Benton, Linn, Jones,
Clinton, Johnson, Scott, Delaware, Buchanan, Cedar, Fayette, and
Keokuk. While most of these counties were established outright the
wording of the act relating to Dubuque county implies that it was
looked upon as the former county reduced in size, which was not
correct, as this land from which these counties were laid out also
included much of the Sac and Fox cession made after Dubuque county had
been formed and laid out, and which county had not been ceded to the
United States government.

These boundary lines were reduced in size later; however the boundaries
of Dubuque, Delaware, Jackson, Jones, Linn, Clinton, Cedar, and Scott
have remained as they were laid out at the time. The Territory of Iowa
was created by an act of congress approved June 12, 1838.

Among the bills passed by the first legislature, which met during the
winter of 1838 and 1839, was the following: "An Act to Organize the
County of Linn, and establish the Seat of Justice thereof.

     "Section 1. Be it enacted by the Council and House of
     Representatives of the Territory of Iowa, that the county of
     Linn be and the same is hereby organized from and after the
     10th of June next, and the inhabitants of said county be
     entitled to all the rights and privileges to which, by law,
     the inhabitants of other organized counties of this
     Territory are entitled, and the said county shall be a part
     of the Third Judicial District, and the District Court shall
     be held at the seat of justice of said county, or such other
     place as may be provided until the seat of justice is
     established.

     "Section 2. That Richard Knott, Lyman Dillon and Benjamin
     Nye be and they are hereby appointed Commissioners to locate
     the seat of justice in said county, and shall meet at the
     house of William Abbe, on the first Monday of March next, in
     said county, and shall proceed forthwith to examine and
     locate a suitable place for the seat of justice of said
     county, having particular reference to the convenience of
     the county and healthfulness of the location.

[Illustration: DOUBLE LOG CABIN Built by Wm. Abbe, Linn County's First
Settler]

     "Section 3. The Commissioners, or a majority of them, shall,
     within ten days after their meeting at the aforesaid place,
     make out and certify to the Governor of this Territory,
     under their hands and seals, a certificate containing a
     particular description of the situation of the location
     selected for the aforesaid county seat; and on the receipt
     of such certificate, the Governor shall issue his
     proclamation affirming and declaring the said location to be
     the seat of justice of said county of Linn.

     "Section 4. The Commissioners aforesaid shall, before they
     enter upon their duties, severally take and subscribe an
     oath before some person legally authorized to administer the
     same, viz: I, ............, do solemnly swear (or affirm)
     that I am not, either directly or indirectly, interested in
     the location of the seat of justice of Linn County, nor do I
     own any property in lands, or any claims, within the said
     county of Linn. So help me God. (Signed) A. B., etc.

     "Section 5. If, at any time within one year thereafter, it
     shall be shown that the said Commissioners, or any of them,
     received any present, gratuity, fee or reward in any form
     other than that allowed by law, or before the expiration of
     six months after the Governor's proclamation, declaring the
     said seat of justice permanent, become interested in said
     town or any lands in its immediate vicinity, the
     Commissioner or Commissioners shall, upon conviction thereof
     by indictment in the District Court of the county in which
     he or they may reside, be guilty of a high misdemeanor, and
     be forever disqualified to vote at any election or to hold
     any office of trust or profit within this Territory.

     "Section 6. The Commissioners aforesaid shall receive, upon
     making out their certificate of the location of the seat of
     justice of said county, each two dollars per day, and also
     three dollars for every twenty miles going and returning
     from their respective homes. Approved January 15, 1839."

Two of the Commissioners named in the act, Richard Knott and Benjamin
Nye, accepted the trust, meeting at the house of William Abbe, two and
one-half miles west of what is now Mount Vernon.

The Commissioners located the county seat in the middle of the county
and named it "Marion," in honor of one of the Revolutionary generals.
The Commissioners reported to the governor of the territory the
completion of their work, and Governor Robert Lucas proclaimed the
county of Linn duly established.

For election purposes Linn county was attached to Cedar, Johnson, and
Jones, the first polling precinct being located at Westport, which had
been laid out by Israel Mitchell with the expectation that this would
be the county seat, Mr. Mitchell believing that the county seat should
be located on the river, and that that location would be near enough
the center for all practical purposes.

In October, 1838, the entire county composed one precinct, and
thirty-two ballots were cast for candidates for the legislature.
Charles Whittlesey was chosen for the senate and Robert G. Roberts for
the house. The first county election was held in August, 1839, when
three commissioners were selected at Westport--L. M. Strong, Peter
McRoberts, and Samuel C. Stewart. This body had the same powers as was
later conferred upon the county supervisors. This commission first sat
as a body officially September 9, 1839, in the log house of James W.
Willis. Hosea W. Gray was sheriff and acted as clerk of the court until
a clerk was duly appointed.

The minutes state:

     "The Board proceeded to the appointment of a Clerk.
     Thereupon it was ordered that John C. Berry be and is hereby
     appointed to the office of Clerk of the Board of Linn County
     Commissioners.

     "Ordered. That the county seat of Linn County be and is
     hereby called and shall hereafter be known and designated by
     the name of Marion."

At this session W. H. Smith and Andrew J. McKean were appointed
constables for the county. Jonas Martin was appointed road supervisor,
his district embracing all the land east of Marion and west of Big
creek and east on the Marion and Davenport roads crossing Big creek.
"It was also authorized that as Linn County had no safe place for the
keeping of criminals that Sheriff Gray contract with the Sheriff of
Muscatine County for the keeping of one Samuel Clews, and that the
Sheriff borrow funds to pay for the support and keeping of said Clews
while in confinement."

It seems that the board met monthly and the county was divided into
three voting precincts as follows: One at William Abbe's, known as
Sugar Grove Precinct, with the following judges: William Abbe, John
Cole, and John McAfferty; one at Marion, with James W. Bassett, Henry
Thompson, and Rufus H. Lucore, judges; one at Michael Greene's, with
Michael Greene, James Cummings, and Bartimeas McGonigle, judges.

At this time Ross McCloud was appointed county surveyor and was ordered
to make the survey of the county seat and report, which he did, and
also to lay out additions, which was done. A county jail was also
ordered erected in January, 1840, and the contract for the building of
the same was let to William Abbe and Asher Edgerton for the sum of
$635.00; the first money raised by sale of lots in Marion was applied
on the contract for the erection of the jail.


THE FIRST SURVEY

The first survey was made in 1838, being all of Jones county and
townships 84, 85, and 86 north, in range 5, west, in Linn county. This
was made public in the newspapers and many settlers came in, taking the
best lands that had been surveyed and squatting on the other land which
they knew would soon be open for settlement. Linn Grove was an ideal
place, and here in an early day a large number settled. The sale of
lands in the county was advertised to take place in January, 1840. On
account of the difficulties of transportation, the settlers petitioned
to have the same postponed until the summer of that year, which
petition was granted. George Greene, who had been a school teacher near
Ivanhoe and even at that time was a man of no ordinary ability, was
asked to see what could be done in changing the place from Dubuque to
Marion. Mr. Greene volunteered to go to Washington and lay the matter
before congress, or the men in charge of the land department. After
some time he succeeded in his mission and won the grateful respect of
his fellow pioneers, saving them a great deal of money. Thus, for a
time, Marion was a United States land office, and the people of Linn
county who had little money to spend could claim their lands without
much trouble.


THE FIRST COURT HOUSE IN THE COUNTY

The first court house built in the county was a log structure for the
use of the pioneers. This structure was erected during the years 1840
and 1841. As there was no money in the county treasury and as the court
house was needed, the settlers donated their labor. They cut the logs,
hauled them to Marion, and constructed the building, the roof being of
shakes and the floor of puncheons. Among those who helped erect this
first seat of justice were James and John Hunter, the Stambaugh
brothers, James and Elias Doty, and others. The first case, it is said,
tried in this court house was one brought against James Doty for
jumping a claim on the west side of the river, adjoining the claim of
Robert Ellis, the question being whether or not a man erecting a bark
building and claiming the land had complied with the law. The jury was
impaneled and a trial had which lasted for some time. When the case
went to the jury the judge and all vacated so that the jury could use
the small room in arriving at a decision. The jury was out the
afternoon and all night, and at ten o'clock the next morning they
reported that they were unable to agree. During all this time they had
had nothing to eat, and the water they had to drink was very poor. Upon
this jury sat James Hunter, one of the first settlers of the county,
who was the only stubborn one to hold out in favor of Doty. He used to
tell later that he felt that he could never look James Doty in the face
if he should consent to such a verdict as the other eleven had framed
up against him. The case was tried at a subsequent term when the jury
decided in favor of Doty, to the effect that while he was later than
the claimant in making his claim he was a _bona fide_ settler with the
intention of becoming a permanent settler.

The next court house built in Marion was a frame structure still
standing just west of the present brick building, and now used as a
hotel. The present brick court house was erected by George W. Gray, the
brick superstructure being built by Peter D. Harman, of Bertram, father
of Warren Harman, of Cedar Rapids. Much of the carpenter work was done
by that old pioneer, recently deceased, William Patterson, father of W.
D. Patterson, of Cedar Rapids.

The first jail was erected in January, 1840, the contract for the
building being awarded to William Abbe and Asher Edgerton for $635.00.
The building was finished by May 1st of the same year. The first moneys
raised by sale of lands were applied on this contract.

At the July session, 1849, the county was divided into three districts
as follows: the townships of Washington and Fayette composed District
No. 1; Franklin and Brown composed District No. 2; and Marion and
Putnam District No. 3. At the July session, 1840, the board of
commissioners began to discuss the question of township organizations.
A vote of the county was ordered at the next election to determine the
voice of the people; the election took place in August of that year and
resulted in favor of the proposition.

Lists of townships are as follows: Marion, Franklin, Washington,
Fayette, Putnam, and Brown established in 1841; Linn and Rapids, 1843;
Otter Creek, 1844; Buffalo and Maine, 1848; Monroe, 1849; Spring Grove,
1853; Clinton, 1854; Jackson, 1855; College, Bertram, Boulder, and
Fairfax, 1858; Grant, 1872; and Cedar, 1906.


THE JUDICIARY

The first records of the district court held in Linn county are dated
Monday, October 26, 1840, Iowa Territory, Linn county. Pursuant to an
act of the legislature of the territory, approved July, 1840, the
district court of the United States and also for the Territory of Iowa
met at Marion in said county on Monday, October 26, 1840. Present: The
Hon. Jos. D. Williams, judge of the second judicial district for the
territory; W. G. Woodward, district attorney of the United States for
the district of Iowa; R. P. Lowe, prosecuting attorney for the second
judicial district; H. W. Gray, sheriff of the county of Linn; S. H.
Tryon, clerk of the district court; Lawrence Maloney for the marshal of
the territory.

The following grand jurors were among the best known settlers: Aaron
Usher, Samuel Ross, James Leverich, D. W. King, Israel Mitchell, W. H.
Chambers, William Donahoo, Dan Curtis, W. T. Gilberts, G. A. Patterson,
Isaac Butler, John Goudy, J. A. Gibson, Joe Barnett, Asher Edgerton,
William Chambers, O. L. Bolling, Dan J. Doty, and Joseph Warford. As
bailiff of the grand jury served Perry Oxley, one of the best known
settlers.

The petit jurors were: D. A. Woodbridge, Isaac Carroll, G. W. Gray, B.
McGonegal, John McCloud, Thomas Goudy, J. W. Willis, John Long, J. W.
Margrove, Ira Simmons, John Crow, Joe Carroway, Steve Osborn, H. B.
Mason, O. R. Gregory, John Nation, Thomas Maxwell, and George Yiesly.

One of the early cases of record is that of A. Moriarty vs. N. G.
Niece. One of the early jury trials was that of H. C. Dill vs. John
Barnett: one of the first criminal cases was that of Territory vs. W.
K. Farnsworth, indicted for starting a prairie fire; the jury returned
a verdict of "not guilty."

The probate docket is a very small volume but is filled with entries of
much historical interest concerning the old citizens of the territory.
Among a number of entries can be found the following: In the estate of
A. Coles, claim filed and allowed November 8, 1842; in the estate of
Thomas Gray, claims allowed in 1844; in the estate of J. Barnett,
claims allowed in 1843 in favor of Israel Mitchell in the amount of
$4.50; in the estate of John Crow, claims allowed 1842, as well as
against the estate of Elias Doty, administered upon in 1843 by M. J.
Doty and Jos. Crain, administrators. The estate of A. L. Ely takes up a
number of pages.

The first default case seems to be listed for the October term, 1840,
that of James D. Stockton vs. Stephen Osborn, et al, the claim being
assigned by John O. Gray to plaintiff. The next case was that of Thomas
W. Campbell and Perry Oxley vs. John Barnett, which was a transcript
from J. G. Cole, a justice of the peace. R. P. Lowe acted as district
attorney, while Isaac Butler was foreman of the grand jury.

The first entry made by a native of a foreign country to become a
citizen of the United States was made by Peter Garron, stating that he
was then a resident of Linn county and that he was formerly a subject
of Scotland of the United Kingdom of England and Ireland, and that it
was his intention to renounce allegiance to Queen Victoria and become a
faithful citizen of the United States.

The first divorce action was brought by Dyer Usher against Mary Usher
at the October term, 1842, but it seems that the notice of publication
was not served as ordered and no decree was granted.

The first decree of divorce granted was that on the petition of Mrs.
Parthena C. Hewitt vs. Abraham Hewitt, rendered at the March term,
1844.


CIRCUIT COURT

Pursuant to an act of the legislature of Iowa, approved April 3, 1868,
the county of Linn became part of the second circuit of the eighth
judicial district, the circuit consisting of Cedar, Linn, and Jones
counties, Hon. S. Yates, of Cedar, being elected judge.

The first term was held at Marion January, 1869, when W. G. Thompson
appeared as prosecuting attorney and A. J. McKean as clerk.

The legislature in a few years changed the boundaries of this circuit,
making it composed of Cedar, Linn, Johnson, Jones, Iowa, Tama, and
Benton counties. It was known as the eighth district of the circuit and
district courts. John McKean was judge of the circuit court and John
Shane, of Vinton, judge of the district court.

By an act of the legislature the circuit court was abolished and Linn
county was incorporated into a district composed of Linn, Cedar, and
Jones counties with three judges.


NOTED AND EXCITING TRIALS

Linn county has had its share of noted trials, and many are the pages
which may be gleaned from its musty records to show how treachery,
cowardice, and selfishness have here, as in many other places, played
their parts. It is not best to uncover many of these pages, as it would
perhaps add nothing to the general information or be of any value
except as historical relics of a former age.

One of the first murder cases in the county, at least as far as known,
was that of Nathan Carnagy who was brutally assaulted by James Reed in
Marion in 1847. Reed had been drinking heavily and got into a quarrel
with Carnagy about some old trouble. Reed was arrested, tried before a
jury, and acquitted.

Another case was that of the killing of Pat O'Connell by Samuel Butler
in 1865, the affair growing out of a dispute over some property
interests. The parties met on a public highway, a quarrel ensued with
disastrous results. The jury in this case also returned a verdict of
"not guilty."

[Illustration: FIRST PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, CEDAR RAPIDS, COMPLETED IN

[Illustration: RESIDENCE OF WILLISTON JONES, WHERE COE COLLEGE WAS BORN
FROM CARROLL'S HISTORY]

John Akers was murdered in a saloon in Cedar Rapids in 1864 by one
Decklots; the jury returned a verdict of "guilty." This sad affair was
due to liquor, both parties being more or less under its influence at
the time the quarrel began.

There are a number of murder cases of an appalling nature on record;
sometimes a conviction and sometimes an acquittal resulted.

On the civil side of the calendar can be found many cases attracting
attention, sometimes on account of the charges made, at other times on
account of the large amounts of money involved. In this forum
magnificent addresses were heard, and no lawyer practicing at the Linn
county bar was ever a miser of his eccentricities, whatever they might
have been. Most of them had the thread of the attorney in their nature
and took to oratory like a duck to water, and most of them in these
early pioneer days went in to win the jury at all hazards, possessing
the power to stir the heart and to make their personality felt.


THE ERA OF THE OUTLAW

Along the American frontier were always found the outlaws; sometimes
they outnumbered the honest settler and sometimes not, depending more
or less upon conditions. Outlaws preferred to hover on the frontier
where courts of justice were unknown and where the sons of toil, busy
with making a living, had no time to defend themselves against
outlawry. Some of these outlaws had committed theft and robbery and
were living upon this borderland of civilization, knowing that it would
be perfectly safe under assumed names. Others came here for the special
purpose, knowing it was easier to make a living by theft than by honest
toil. Thus, the Linn county frontier at an early date was infested with
this class of people, and for a number of years the rights of the
people had to be protected by associations organized for this purpose,
and made up of the best class in the community, until such a time as
law and order could be enforced by decrees of court and by penitentiary
sentences.

When the first white settler came into the Red Cedar valley there were
only two counties fully organized west of the Mississippi, with the
exception of the state of Missouri. These counties were Dubuque and Des
Moines. They extended from a flag station at Fort Armstrong back into
the country forty miles, and from the Missouri line to a line running
westward from Prairie du Chien in Wisconsin. It was a large tract of
country, and offered secure hiding places for law violators. In this
wild country, along rivers where the timber was thick, hiding places
for the outlaw were offered, and when settlers did come in the outlaw
did not like to remove, and, consequently tormented the actual settler
and frequently took by stealth or force such personal property as he
wanted.

In the early day the country bordering on the Cedar river was flooded
with counterfeiters, and it is stated that this counterfeit money was
so well made that it was difficult to tell which was the good money and
which the bad and, in fact, at times it seems that the good money was a
scarce article. No one was able to tell where this counterfeit money
came from, but it is supposed very little, if any, was made here but
that it was imported from other places and distributed by "healers" on
a percentage basis. While a cry was raised against counterfeit money,
only the government could handle such cases and very little was done to
start proceedings. Now and then the government attorney would bring a
case or two, but as a rule the defendants were generally released by a
jury, many of whom were friends of the parties accused.

It was not until horse stealing became prevalent that the people arose
in arms against the outlaw and formed associations called "anti-horse
thief" associations. It was a difficult thing at first to prosecute,
as the gang was well organized and had a perfect system of stations,
agents, signs, and signals. The members of these gangs which infested
Cedar, Jones, and Linn counties in the early days dressed better than
the honest farmer, were more charitable, and in the day time, at least,
were looked upon as the most respectable persons in the community. They
were shrewd and cunning in their business transactions, and hedged
themselves in such a way as to escape detection and exposure for a long
time. These "free booters" and plunderers would move from county to
county and from community to community if things got a little hot and
they feared exposure. In counties where they were in the majority they
would intimidate and scare the actual settlers, even if these knew
positively that depredations had been made. And frequently the honest
settler who attacked and complained was forced to leave the country
instead of the outlaw who had many friends who came to his rescue. Many
a man who was known to make a complaint before a grand jury, to a
prosecuting attorney, or judge would be trailed by a company of
outlaws, threatening letters would be written against himself and
members of his family, that his buildings would be destroyed by fire if
he persisted in bringing suits or attempted to file an information of
any kind against any members of the band.

A few of these men who were at least accused of being members of these
various gangs of counterfeiters, horse thieves and other desperadoes
may be mentioned.

Perhaps the most noted ones were the members of the Brodie gang,
composed of John Brodie, and his four sons--John, Jr., Stephen,
William, and Hugh--who came into Linn county in 1839 and were among the
first settlers in this county. They were natives of Ohio. Some had
lived in Michigan for a time, and before coming here had commenced
their career of villainy. On account of some misdemeanor they were
driven from Clear Ford on the Mohican river in what is now Ashland
county, Ohio, in 1830 or 1831, and sought refuge for a time in Steuben
county, Indiana. Here they remained for a couple of years when they
became so notorious as to arouse the country against them, and they
fled westward in about 1835 and found their way into what was known as
the Rock river country, or Brodie's Grove, Dement township, Ogle
county, Illinois. In this part of Illinois at this time the country was
completely under the control of outlaws and desperadoes, and here the
Brodies found congenial companionship.

Early in 1839 the Brodies gang were driven out by an organized society
called the "regulators," composed of law abiding people who insisted
upon law enforcement. They then drifted westward and located in Linn
county. From this time on for a number of years there was scarcely a
term of court but that one or more members of this family was arraigned
for trial on some criminal charge or other.

Sam Leterel, Christian Gove, James Case, also known as Jim Stoutenberg,
McConlogue, Squires, McBroom, and others were members of this gang.
McConlogue resided for a time at Cedar Bluffs, later removing into
Johnson county where Morse is now located. Stoutenberg resided at times
with McConlogue and at times with Squires. A number of others
associated with the gang and lived on the borders of Linn and adjoining
counties and went by various names. Where they came from no one knew
and they dropped out of sight if there was any danger of arrest and
conviction.

In 1839 John Goudy and his son-in-law, Thomas McElheny, and a son
settled in Linn county, and it was noised abroad that the family was
very wealthy. To ascertain whether or not they had money, some time in
April, 1840, a man by the name of Switzer was sent to visit the Goudys
under the pretense of wanting to borrow money, the real object being to
ascertain whether or not the parties kept money and whether or not he
could obtain a pretended loan. The loan was declined for some reason or
other, but it is supposed that Switzer learned enough in his talk with
the Goudy family to know that they had money and there would be a
chance to make a good haul. The gang went up along the Cedar river on
the west side and crossed the river about where Goudy's home was. Here
McConlogue had some conversation with a person who knew him. About
midnight of a day in April the door of the Goudy cabin was forced open
and the inmates awoke to find themselves surrounded by five burglars
who threatened their lives if they did not give up their money. Old Mr.
Goudy replied that he had but little money, only $40.00, and that they
could find that in his vest pocket. The vest was searched and the money
found. They insisted that he had more and demanded it. The old man
persisted that it was every dollar he had, or that was about the house.
The leader of the gang then ordered the house to be searched and
directed the occupants of the beds to cover their heads at once. In the
shuffle for places Mrs. McElheny, a daughter of Goudy, recognized
Switzer, who had been there to borrow the money a few days before, and
also another member of the gang who was well known by the family. In
the search for money a purse containing $120.00 belonging to a
daughter, Hannah, was found by the burglars. In an old leather belt
used by Mr. Goudy there was also a $100.00 bill which the robbers
overlooked or could not find in their hurry to search the house.

They became very angry at not finding any more money, having expected
to find $9,000.00 which Mr. Goudy was reported to have had in the house
at the time. The robbers on leaving the house cursed every member of
the family, and seemed much put out at the haul they had made. Captain
Thomas H. Goudy, a married son, lived near his father's cabin. He had
been a captain of militia in Ohio and his uniform was hanging upon the
wall. The robbers seeing this remarked "a military officer must be a
rich man," and his money was demanded, but they received nothing, and
after turning over everything in the house and finding only some
provisions, they left Goudy and went to the cabin of William F.
Gilbert, another prominent settler in the neighborhood, who was also
supposed to have considerable money. On the night in question Gilbert
had stopping with him three men, the mail carrier who operated a stage
between Dubuque and Iowa City, and two others. In the Gilbert house, as
in the other house, the cabin consisted of only one room with several
beds, and on this night Mrs. Goudy and her children occupied one bed,
the strangers another bed, while Goudy and the mail carrier slept on
the floor by the fire. The entrance of the robbers was so sudden that
before the occupants knew what was going on they were covered with guns
and clubs, and their money was demanded. Goudy rallied to defend his
home, and so did the mail carrier who slept near the door. Both men
were knocked down and the cheek bone on one side of the mail carrier's
face was smashed completely by a blow from a club wielded by one of the
robbers.

The house was thoroughly searched and the drawer of a box which was
supposed to be opened by a secret spring known to no one but members of
the family was forced and a $50.00 bill and some $30.00 or $40.00 in
change were found and taken. While all the older members were
frightened Mr. Goudy's son, during the plundering, arose in bed and
recognized a neighbor--one Goodrich, who lived but a half mile
distant--as one of the robbers. This neighbor had up to this time been
looked upon as a respectable man. It was he who opened the drawer as
quickly as though he was one of the family. The robbers secured as
their share of the booty this night about $240.00. A young daughter of
Mr. Goudy, who remembered well that night, was later married to Judge
John Shane, of Vinton, a well known jurist and a most excellent judge.

This wholesale robbery stirred the whole country, and Captain Thomas
Goudy especially, being a military man, insisted that now it was high
time for the people to arouse themselves and if the officers of the law
refused to do anything then the settlers would take the law into their
own hands and start something going. Thomas and his father went to J.
W. Tallman at Antwerp and Colonel Prior Scott at Pioneer Grove for
advice and counsel, and especially to apprehend one Wallace who was
implicated in this robbery. Colonel Scott went among his people and
organized a "mutual protective association," the settlers hunted up
their rifles and shot guns, and the organization was ready to begin
work. Wallace had fled, but pursuers were on his track and he was
apprehended in Illinois City in Illinois, ten miles above Muscatine, by
a citizen named Coleman and turned over to Thomas Goudy and his party.
Coleman's reputation in the vicinity was not the best and he had been
suspected of harboring outlaws, but it was stated on account of some
difficulty in the division of spoils he and Wallace had had a falling
out and hence Wallace's easy capture.

A warrant was taken out for the arrest of Switzer, and when Wallace was
returned Switzer was also arrested and a preliminary examination was
held before John G. Cole, one of the first justices of the peace in
Linn county. Both of the parties were held to bail. Their cases came on
for trial at Tipton at the October term, 1841, of the district court.

James W. Tallman, a resident of Antwerp, accompanied by several
neighbors, started out to arrest Switzer, a large man and an ugly one.
Switzer resided near Halderman's mill. At two o'clock in the morning a
posse surrounded Switzer's home. He refused to open the door and they
waited till daylight before he was taken in custody. Switzer's cabin
was a perfect arsenal, there being guns, pistols, and ugly knives
scattered all around.

Later James Stoutenberg, also known as Jim Case, was arrested at
McConlogue's as an accomplice and member of the gang. He was taken into
the woods near McConlogue's and examined in the court of "Judge Lynch"
in order to obtain a confession from him, and he was finally tied to a
tree and severely flogged. He was never seen alive again. Some assert
that he left the country, and others that members of the party carried
him to the Cedar river, tied him to a stone raft and left him to his
fate.

McConlogue was also arrested as being a member of the gang in the
robbery, but he established an alibi. Being satisfied that he was
guilty of helping to plan the robbery, the pioneer settlers, duly
aroused, tried him by rules not known in the ordinary law court. He was
sentenced to be hanged, but finally it was agreed that this sentence
should be changed to whipping, and that each one of the citizens should
give him five lashes on the bare back, and if that failed to bring a
confession as to the particulars of the robbery and the extent and
names of the gang, then he should be whipped the second time until he
died. Blows continued to fall upon his quivering and bleeding back
until he implored for mercy and promised to reveal all he knew about
the robbery and the operations of the "free booters." He admitted
having knowledge of the Goudy robbery and that he received as his share
of the booty $25.00. He also admitted that Wallace was the leader of
the gang at this time and that Switzer was another member of the gang
of five men who perpetrated the robbery. The members of the association
after this confession let him go, but first applied a solution of salt
on his lacerated flesh, followed by an application of slippery elm bark
to remind him of the ordeal he had recently passed through, and which
he never forgot. At this time McConlogue was under indictment in
Johnson county for assaulting a man named Brown with intent to rob him;
on this charge he was tried and sent to the penitentiary.

Goodrich, a neighbor of the Gilberts, who had taken part in the robbery
and who had been recognized by the latter's son, was also horse whipped
and gagged at the same time but he refused to answer any questions and
denied having taken part in the robbery. Soon after this he removed
from the county and was never heard of afterwards.

McConlogue's admission implicated McBroom, who had been known for some
time previously as one of the brightest men of the gang, and who was
also supposed to be a lawyer. He was also caught and whipped nearly to
death near what is known as Scott's mill, without making any
confession, but with threat that if anything more was heard of any
attempted robbery of any kind by any member of the gang everyone,
including himself, would be swung up to the first oak tree. It is
needless to say that he immediately left the country and was never
heard of again.

[Illustration: DANIEL SEWARD HAHN One of the First Settlers in Linn
County]

William Stretch, an old settler, many years afterwards made a trip down
the Mississippi and there in one of the river cities, either New
Orleans or Memphis, he met and recognized McBroom who had been so
severely flogged on the banks of the Cedar river. McBroom claimed that
he had lived an honest life since removing from the Cedar river and he
begged Stretch not to say anything about it, at least in his new home.
Stretch agreed to this, but investigated to ascertain whether or not
McBroom had told the facts, and found that he was a respectable
citizen, one of the leaders in that city, and had accumulated a
fortune--between forty and fifty thousand dollars.

Another member of the gang, a cousin of the Brodie boys, and in many
ways a bad fellow, was overtaken in Washington township, this county,
while driving and there shot by a band of what was known as
"regulators" or members of the "anti-horse thief association."
Seventeen bullets had penetrated his body. Who had a hand in this act
is not known, although the members are said to have belonged to some of
the first families of the county. When Wilson was caught he was passing
through the county with a team of stolen horses which had been brought
from the eastern part of the state.

The trial of Switzer, who had been indicted for burglary in 1840, was
transferred on a change of venue from Linn to Cedar county. It came up
at the October term of the district court, Joseph Williams presiding.
George McCoy was sheriff and William Knott was his deputy. The
following named persons, all well known settlers, sat on this jury: C.
Kline, William Morgan, Elias Epperson, Abe Kiser, Porter McKinstry, P.
Wilkinson, J. S. Lewis, John Lewis, William Denny, W. H. Bolton, Peter
Diltz, and Samuel Gilliland.

Considerable excitement prevailed at this trial. Switzer was
represented by able counsel who put up a great defense. Mrs. McElheny
and other members of the family unmistakably identified Switzer as the
person who had been there before to borrow the money and who was one of
the leaders on the night of the robbery. Switzer tried to prove an
alibi, and had a number of people who swore that he had been at another
place on the night of the robbery. It is said that the jury was out two
days and two nights and during this deliberation Switzer tried to
approach Knott by saying that he wanted help and that as soon as Knott
found out the jury had found him guilty he asked him to give him some
sign by taking a handkerchief out of his pocket. What he would have
attempted then is not known. Knott refused, the jury disagreed, eleven
standing for conviction and one for acquittal.

During the trial a large grey horse was hitched in front of the
building used as a court house, for what purpose no one ever
understood, nor did any one know who was the owner of the horse.
Switzer had a number of friends who hung around the jury and around the
court house during the trial. As the jury came out one of the jurors
had a handkerchief protruding from the side pocket of his coat. Switzer
recognized the signal. With the nimbleness and quickness of a bare back
rider he jumped on to the horse and darted away like a cyclone. Knowing
the proposition Switzer made to Knott there seems to be some reason to
believe that this member of the jury had given Switzer the sign. When
the jury reported they were unable to agree, Switzer's friends started
out to find and convey to him the result, but could not find him until
the day following, when they found him concealed among some of the
timber along Sugar creek.

Another warrant was issued for his arrest, but there was some delay in
serving this notice and in the meantime he made his escape. In 1852
William Knott was in California and there met Switzer at Carson river
in Nevada territory and had a conversation with him. Switzer admitted
that he had been in a very tight place when he was under arrest in
Cedar county, and he asked Knott to convey his best wishes to the juror
who had hung out in his favor. Mr. Knott ascertained that Switzer's
morals had not changed any on account of his removal. In 1874 Judge
John Shane and his wife visited California, and upon inquiry at Vallejo
ascertained that Switzer lived in that vicinity, and although a very
dissolute and reckless man and feared by all, he had accumulated a
handsome fortune. He also discovered that the sons were following in
the footsteps of their father, and that one of them was under
indictment for having killed a man.

At the time of the Switzer arrest and trial for the Gilbert robbery a
civil suit had also been brought against him for the recovery of the
money and a judgment was obtained. Judge Shane consulted an attorney
and tried to get a transcript of his judgment in order to collect the
same, but for some reason the records could not be found and the
judgment could not be transcripted. Switzer died in California in 1877.

One of Switzer's best friends and a hanger-on at the court, a
desperado, surrounded by a number of fellows of the same type, was
Christopher Burns. He carried revolvers and bowie knives and wore a
gentleman's cloak of the old style thrown loosely about his shoulders.
The sheriff, his deputy, and a number of men surrounding them also
carried arms, and in case the jury had returned a verdict of "guilty"
it was Burns's intention, no doubt, to rescue his friend and a bloody
battle would have taken place. Burns left the country immediately and
was shot by a neighbor in a quarrel on the upper Missouri river in
1845.

The whipping of McBroom, Case, and others, and the arrest of Switzer
and his flight put a stop to these outrages, so from 1841 to 1855,
while many suspicious persons still lived in the community, they were
more guarded in their movements than before, and these desperate acts
did not take place, although for many years after this a good horse was
not always safe property to keep in the country.


EARLY SETTLEMENT

From _History of Linn County_, 1878

It seems that the first store was located at Westport where there was a
barter trade carried on with Indians. W. H. Merritt ran a store at
Ivanhoe in 1838, which was located on the government road. John Henry
seems to have operated the store at Westport, but whether he bought
this from Wilbert Stone is uncertain. It is stated that William, or
Wilbert, Stone, sold his store or had one at Westport about 1837 where
he did some trading with the Indians. He must have been there as early
as 1837 because he sold out his interest to John Henry and removed
further up to what became Cedar Rapids, and had been living there for
some time when Robert Ellis found him on the west side of the river
upon his arrival in May, 1838.

None of the land at that time had been surveyed, so all the rights the
people had were known as "squatter" rights, which they sold as any
other land, and which would give them the privilege of filing on it
when the land would get into the market. Much of this land was handled
that way. The southeastern and eastern part of the county were first
settled, and then settlements were made along the Cedar river, which
would be natural for the reason that people had to use the river more
or less in keeping in communication with other places.

It would be impossible to give the names of all the early settlers for
the reason that some only remained a short time and moved away again
and the names of these have been lost. A few only can be mentioned to
give the reader an idea of where and how certain towns were staked out
and buildings commenced. The Linn county lands first came into the
market in March, 1843, and not till then, did the settlers come in any
large numbers. All were anxious to get free lands. The town sites were
laid out as follows, though they were only squatter's rights: Westport
in July, 1838, by Israel Mitchell; Columbus (Cedar Rapids), September,
1838, by William [or Wilbert] Stone; Ivanhoe, October, 1838, by Anson
Cowles; while the town site of Cedar Rapids was laid out by N. B. Brown
and others August 4, 1841. The first plat, however, recorded was by the
father of Elias Doty. This was recorded after the land had come into
market, when Westport was re-named Newark, and was filed November 12,
1844.

The tide of civilization gradually flowed westward from the Mississippi
river. The regular chain of progress is clearly shown, and forms a
portion of the history of Linn county. Young men pushed bravely ahead,
claiming rights to unsurveyed lands, expecting in a short time a rise
in values and big money in their holdings. Many of these men were
single and never intended to make this, or any other community, their
permanent home. All they wanted was to pick out the best claims, erect
shacks, hold them down until men with families came, who had a little
money and were willing to pay so as to get a home at once. Many of
these young venturesome spirits frequently in six months or a year
would pick up from $500.00 to a couple of thousand for a claim,
depending somewhat upon the improvements made. At times these squatters
would erect fairly good log houses and stables, and dig a well or two,
and would also put in a little garden stuff--potatoes and the like--so
as to keep the family partly, at least, over winter. Crops and all
improvements would go with the bargain. Many of these men drifted
farther westward and undoubtedly lived nearly all their lives on what
might be known as the border land of civilization. They preferred this
kind of life, and whenever a community was settled up it lost all
interest for the original pioneer; he wanted and preferred to live
among frontier ruffians; would fight if he had to, and would always
defend himself against any intruder. These men enjoyed this kind of a
life and thrived upon it, and all they cared for was a little money,
good times, and the freedom they so much craved and which the frontier
afforded.

"While it is true that those who located in this county in the years
1837 and 1838 came from the east, it is also certain that this section
would not have been reached so early in this century had the lands
immediately west of the Mississippi been unselected. It was, and still
is, the desire of genuine pioneers to find a spot beyond the confines
of civilization, no matter how crude the outlying stations may be."

The first settlement of whites in Iowa had been at Dubuque, where
Dubuque and his followers worked the mines at that place. This at one
time was a great center of attraction, but as the government restricted
settlers from coming in, they were driven back until treaty
arrangements were made with the Indians, who were the owners of the
land upon which the mines were located. These men who first came as
miners early saw the exceeding beauty and fertility of the Iowa lands,
and thus news was spread among the people of the east before the Iowa
lands were thrown open for settlement. Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were
by this time pretty much settled up, and so was Missouri and nearly all
the land adjoining the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Thus it was that as
soon as the word came from the government that part of Iowa was thrown
open to settlement adventurous men and brave women soon began to cross
the Mississippi and to settle in various parts of what was then so well
known as the Black Hawk land. There were no roads in those days, not
even trails, and consequently a person did not dare to venture out on
the prairie, but he generally followed some stream so that he could
find his way back to the starting place, at least.

Most of the people who came west to settle had no idea of where to
locate or of the condition of the Iowa lands. They were bold, fearless,
and determined, as well as resolute, and they pushed on until they
found a locality which suited their fancy and here they pitched their
tents and lived in their wagons until suitable log cabins were erected.

Prior to 1829 there was not even a ferry established at any regular
point on which to cross the river into Iowa; even the miner, Dubuque,
when he wanted to re-cross to the Illinois side had to borrow an Indian
canoe. The familiar Du Bois, who came early into Illinois in Joe Davies
county, trading with the Indians, had no other means of crossing the
river than in Indian canoes. By the latter part of 1829 one John Barrel
was commissioned to maintain a ferry at Rock Island, which at that time
was within the confines of Joe Davies county, which extended for miles
and miles along the river, like Dubuque county on the west side of the
river. Col. George Davenport also obtained a permit to run a ferry from
Davenport across the river, the ferry charges being fixed by the
commissioners so that there could be no hold-up. The following charges
were made, which must have been pretty high for the people of small
means in those days:

     Man and horse                                       $25.00
     Horses or cattle, per head, other than cattle yoke     .37-1/2
     Road wagon                                            1.00
     For each horse hitched to said wagon                   .25
     Each two-horse wagon                                   .75
     Each two-wheeled carriage or cart                     1.00
     One-horse wagon                                        .75
     Each hundred weight of mdse., etc.                     .06

To avoid paying this ferry charge a great many of the settlers started
early in the spring and would cross the river on the ice and thus save
this additional expense. William Abbe and his family, and many others
who settled in Linn county, at least those who were familiar with the
ferry charges, crossed on the ice.

George Davenport established a trading post as early as 1831 at the
mouth of Rock creek, and another on the east side of Cedar river just
above Rochester a short time later. Thus, gradually, there extended a
system of small stores in the bayous, creeks, and rivers where trading
was carried on mainly with the Indians. The settlers who came generally
followed these trails and would be helped and advised where to go and
where to find the best roads, and also as to whether or not the Indians
in the immediate vicinity of the stores were hostile or friendly.

Block houses had also been erected near these frontier stores for
protection in case of Indian outbreaks.

Another trading point was that of Rockingham which was laid out as
early as 1835, and in the early forties considered one of the best
villages in the territory. It was to this place the early settlers came
up to 1841-42 to trade, as well as to Muscatine and Davenport.

The settlers who came late during the summer of 1838-39 were
unfortunate in case they were unable to get enough hay for their stock,
for the winters were very cold and there were no provisions or food to
be purchased, and many a family along the Cedar river in Linn and Cedar
counties during these years endured some severe trials. Money was
scarce, provisions of all kinds high, and no trading posts nearer than
those at Davenport, Muscatine, and Rockingham. It is said that Robert
Ellis and Philip Hull came to William Abbe's on their way to Muscatine
to get provisions in the fall of 1838. William Abbe gave them
$15.00--all the money he had--and with tears in his eyes told them to
buy what they could, for that he did not know what would become of his
wife and children when that was gone, for it was all the money he had
in the world. They were absent about two weeks, and brought back as
much provisions as they could buy with what money they had, and by
hunting during the winter they got along and helped William Abbe. In
the forties William Abbe secured government contracts, and then became
a well-to-do man. Robert Ellis was a partner with Abbe many times in
supplying the outposts with provisions.

[Illustration: LINN COUNTY SCENES]

Many families during the latter thirties and the early forties
experienced some hard times in Iowa. To make the situation and
surroundings still more difficult the creeks and sloughs between the
settlements were treacherous quagmires in which wagons going for or
returning with provisions were sure to settle in up to the hubs, and
when once in the mud there was no way to get them out except by
unloading or by going to the nearest store for help, which would be
many miles away. Sometimes the assistance of two or three additional
yoke of oxen was secured to pull out the wagon.

The winters of 1837-38-39 and 40 began early, snow falling to the
extent of a foot or two as early as the latter part of October, and it
increased as the winter advanced. There was no thaw in January, and the
settlers were completely shut in until about the middle of April. Then
the snow all melted away and the streams were swollen so as to be
impassable. Thus it was impossible to get to any place for food or for
provisions until way into the summer. Consequently the settlers
experienced many hardships, and much of the stock died from sheer
starvation. As early as possible in the spring the settlers would unite
and start off for Muscatine, Dubuque, or Rockingham for provisions, and
on their return would help the needy settlers who had no opportunity to
get away. Sometimes these journeys were undertaken on foot, when two or
three would start off with knapsacks to get the necessary foods and
medicines, and would return as soon as possible.

It is wonderful what the old settlers endured--how they walked a
distance of 100 miles in less than two days. Robert Ellis walked from
Michigan to Iowa; he walked to Dubuque, Muscatine, Davenport, and
Burlington many times, while it is said of William Abbe that he walked
easily 60 miles a day without being very much exhausted. Then, again,
when roads were impassable for wheeled vehicles they would ride
horseback, leading sometimes one horse to be used as a pack horse to
bring back provisions.

To show with how much difficulty the early settlers toiled to get a
foothold in Linn county, it might be well to state the story of the
life of Edward M. Crow, who, as a young man, in 1837 came into the
county to a place near where is now located Viola. He was only 21 years
of age, and came west from Chicago, having previously come from
Indiana. He stopped first in Illinois and having heard of Iowa, came
here in search of cheap land. He was accompanied by James Dawson and
James Gillilan, the latter owning a team of horses. They constructed
ferry boats of their own on which to cross the river. The other two
parties got tired and left. Crow later found Dawson in Illinois. They
travelled over much of Iowa, back and forth, mostly on foot; sometimes
together, sometimes setting out in different directions alone. Finally,
both Dawson and Crow united in Jones county, staking out a claim in
Linn county in July, 1837. Returning to Fox river, Illinois, again in
quest of provisions, they did not come back to Linn county until in
August of that year, when Ed and Garrison Crow and James Dawson began
their settlement, erected a cabin and cut some hay for the winter. They
were without food, and had to make another trip to the borders of
civilization for provisions for the winter. The monotonous months of
winter rolled by, Crow's party subsisting by hunting as best they
could.

A number of settlers came into Brown township during the early years,
such as Jacob Mann, David Mann, his brother, William P. Earle, Asa
Farnsworth, and many others. John Crow, father of Ed Crow, John Lynn,
O. Bennett, Charles Pickney, Benj. Simmons, Solomon Peckham, and
Alexander Rhotan were emigrants who settled here in 1838. All those who
came that year and have been definitely corroborated, or who were
there as real settlers, were the following: Samuel C. Stewart, Peter
McRoberts, John Afferty, William Abbe, Israel Mitchell, Will Gilbert,
J. G. Cole, Hiram Thomas, Joseph Carraway, Jacob Leabo, John Henry, J.
Wilbert Stone, Osgood Shepherd, wife, father and several children,
Robert Ellis, O. S. Bolling, Mr. Ashmore, W. K. Farnsworth, Robert
Osborn, Thomas Campbell, Perry Oxley, Will Vineyard, James Hunter, J.
J. Gibson, Robert Deem, Michael Donahoo, William Chamberlain, Mr.
Williams, Mr. Evans, J. B. Sargent, John Sargent, A. J. McKean, John
Scott, H. W. Gray, S. H. Tryon, Anson Coles, Andrew Safely, Rev.
Christian Troup, D. S. Hahn, Hiram Bales, Asher Edgerton, Peter Roland,
John Stewart, J. E. Boyd, Philip Hull, John Young, Mr. Granger, L. H.
Powell, John McCloud, Mr. Kemp, Listebarger brothers, and many others.

The Hoosier Grove settlement was made in 1838, being in Putnam
township; Isaac and Abner Cox and John Holler, and several others,
settled here that year.

During the year 1839 Otter Creek was settled by Stevens, Michael
Greene, Bart McGonigle, Henry Nelson, William Chamberlain, Dr. J.
Cummings, Will Sullivan and Perry Oliphant.

Dyer Usher and Joel Howard ferried people across the Mississippi near
Muscatine in the summer of 1839. These men died near Covington a few
years ago. Usher always claimed that he was on the site of Cedar Rapids
as early as 1836 and located west of the river two years later. The
young men could make no money in a new country, and while they took
claims they frequently left for civilization to earn a little money. So
it might have been that Usher was a bona fide resident of Linn county,
while he could get no employment nearer than Muscatine.

A number of persons settled early around Cedar Rapids in the timber a
few miles from town. William Knowles located on what is known as Mound
Farm in 1839 and gave this up to the Brodie family, consisting of
parents, five sons and three daughters. The names of the sons were
Hugh, John, William, Steven, and Jesse. Rev George R. Carroll speaks of
the family as having an unsavory reputation. The family removed further
north when some of them at least were accused of being notorious horse
thieves.

Joel Leverich next became the owner of Mound Farm, a person who had
somewhat of a history in the early days of politics in the county. In
1843-44 this property was purchased by George Greene.

A number of people lived along the trail between Marion and Cedar
Rapids. Among those well known not already mentioned may be named
Ambrose Harlan, Dave Woodbridge, J. E. Bromwell, J. P. Glass, Rufus
Lucore, John and Will Hunter, Thomas Hare, Will Willis, and many
others.

       *       *       *       *       *

We quote the following from directories and gazeteers published years
ago. These statements may not be correct in some details, but the facts
were obtained from some who were doubtless familiar with them.

Thus Wolfe in his Cedar Rapids and Kingston directory of 1869 speaks of
John Mann, of Pine Grove, as the first settler in Linn county, he
coming in 1838, and of the first marriage in the county as that of
Sarah Haines to Richard Osborne, in 1839, and the first death as that
of Mrs. Haines, an elderly lady who died from an accident in July,
1838.

He further speaks of the first store in Westport as that of Albert
[should be John] Henry in 1838. It is thought that Stone also carried
on some store or trade with the Indians before this. He speaks of the
second store as being operated by W. H. Merritt in 1839. This should be
1838, as is seen from Merritt's letter to S. W. Durham, found in
another portion of this volume.

The first claim of land in Cedar Rapids was made by William Stone, in
1838, who built a cabin on the banks of the river on Commercial street,
now First street. Is this the Shepherd cabin, and was this so-called
first tavern erected and occupied by Stone, who later was compelled to
vacate it and give up his claim? Mr. Wolfe also speaks of the first saw
and grist mill built by Brown in 1842, the second flour mill built by
Alex Ely in 1845, and the first woolen factory erected by Brown in
1845. Miss Legare built a saw mill in 1851.

As late as 1869 Wolfe speaks of eight flour and saw mills being
operated in and around Cedar Rapids. He speaks further of two woolen
factories and the steam bakery of I. H. Shaver & Co., and of the Fish
paper mill, manufacturing 300 tons of paper annually. The directory
speaks of the American Express Company having an office here as early
as 1859, with W. B. Mack as the first local agent.

The editor also mentions that the learned professions were represented
by ten clergymen, thirteen doctors, and about fifteen lawyers.

He also mentions J. Bell's stage line running daily between Iowa City,
Solon, Western, and Cedar Rapids, and also of a line to Vinton.

The following as seen by a traveller may be of interest. It is from _A
Glimpse of Iowa in 1846_, by J. B. Newhall, Burlington, Iowa, _W. D.
Skillman_, publisher, 1846:

     "Linn county has become proverbial for the excellence of its
     soil, its salubrity of climate, abundance and admirable
     adaption of woodlands to the wants and convenience of the
     settler. The prairies are remarkably fertile, and of
     moderate extent; the timber equally and amply apportioned,
     generally of full growth, consisting, principally, of red
     and white oak, black and white walnut, linn, sugar, maple,
     etc. Linn county is famous for its extensive sugar orchards,
     from some of which 500 to 1,000 weight have been annually
     made. It is well watered by the Red Cedar and its
     tributaries, affording abundance of mill power, much of
     which is already improved.

     "Marion, the seat of justice, is located near the center of
     the county, about four miles east of the Cedar, at the edge
     of a beautiful grove, on a gentle prairie roll. It contains
     several stores, a commodious hotel, postoffice, various
     mechanical establishments, and is a place of considerable
     importance."

The modern traveler speaks of broad meadows, of rich corn fields, and
of large manufacturing interests. This traveler of sixty-five years ago
speaks of timber which has disappeared and of maple sugar orchards
which makes us wonder what they were like.

From Bailey & Hair's _Iowa State Gazetteer_, 1865, we gather these
facts:

     "The county of Linn is so named in honor of a distinguished
     senator of the United States, the Hon. Louis F. Linn, of
     Missouri. It is situated centrally in the eastern half of
     the state, and from fifty to sixty miles west of the
     Mississippi river.

     "It was defined by act of the Territorial Legislature of
     Wisconsin, at its session of 1837 and '38; that Territory
     then including the whole of Iowa within its jurisdiction.
     The county limits were the same as they now remain,
     consisting of twenty Congressional townships, containing an
     area of 720 square miles. It is bounded on the north by
     Buchanan and Delaware counties, east by Jones and Cedar,
     south by Johnson and west by Benton. It is now divided into
     nineteen civil townships, as follows: Bertram, Boulder,
     Brown, Buffalo, Clinton, College, Fairfax, Franklin,
     Fayette, Jackson, Linn, Marion, Maine, Monroe, Otter Creek,
     Putnam, Rapids, Spring Grove, and Washington.

     "The county was duly organized by the Board of County
     Commissioners at their first session held September 9th,
     1839, at the farm house of Mr. James W. Willis, one-half
     mile north of the present town of Marion. The board
     consisted of Samuel C. Stewart, President, Peter McRoberts,
     and Luman M. Strong, Commissioners; Hosea W. Gray, Sheriff;
     and John C. Berry, Clerk.

     "This Board also approved the selection of the county seat,
     which they ordered to be called Marion; divided the county
     into election and road districts; and appointed Andrew J.
     McKean and William H. Smith, Constables. Of the officers and
     persons above named, but two, Messrs. Gray and McKean,
     remain residents of the county, the latter being the present
     Clerk of the District Court.

       *       *       *       *       *

     "The first white settler in this county was John Mann, who
     erected his cabin on Upper Big Creek, in Linn Grove, in the
     month of February, A. D., 1838. He was an emigrant from the
     mountainous region of southwestern Pennsylvania. He was an
     honest, industrious, unlettered, rude sort of man.
     Subsequently he built a small flouring mill. A great flood
     in the spring of 1851 carried away his mill and himself
     together. The unfortunate man was drowned, and his body
     recovered only after several days had elapsed. The flood was
     unprecedented, and was thought to have been caused by a
     water spout. The Little Creek is said to have risen twenty
     feet in about as many minutes.

     "The next permanent settler was John Crow, a North
     Carolinian, who made his home near the east line of the
     county on the Wapsipinicon river, in April, 1838. He was a
     very gentlemanly person, of more than ordinary intelligence,
     wealth and enterprise. He died about five years afterwards,
     much respected. His son, Edward Crow, Esq., now a member of
     the Board of Supervisors of this County, and other
     descendants remain. During the summer of 1838 the
     settlements gradually extended in the east part of the
     county. The only persons now recollected, of that early
     period, as remaining, are John Gibson, of Mount Vernon, and
     Andrew J. McKean, and Hosea W. Gray, of Marion. The first
     family west of Big Creek was that of Jacob Leabo, from
     Kentucky. The first west of Indian Creek was that of James
     W. Bassett, from Vermont. The first Justice of the Peace was
     John McAfferty, commissioned in 1838. The first Judge of
     Probate was Israel Mitchell, a Tennesseean, now residing in
     Oregon. The first Sheriff was Hosea W. Gray. The first Clerk
     of the District Court was Joseph Williams, a Pennsylvanian:
     now said to be in the military service at Memphis,
     Tennessee.

     "The first officiating minister was the Rev. Christian
     Troup, a German Lutheran, who preached regularly in his own
     cabin near the mouth of Spring Creek every Sunday during the
     latter part of the summer of 1838. The first marriage was
     that of Richard Osborn and Sarah Haines, in the spring of
     1839. The first birth was that of a daughter of Mrs. Samuel
     McCartney, in July, 1838. The first death was that of Mrs.
     Haines, an invalid elderly lady, who died from the effects
     of an accidental fall in July, 1838. The second was that of
     James Logan, an Irishman, who was killed by the caving in of
     a well which he was excavating in Marion, July, 1840.

     "The first selected town site was called Westport, of which
     Israel Mitchell was proprietor. It was near the present site
     of the village of Bertram, and was selected in July, 1838.
     This was afterwards abandoned. The next in order of time,
     was called Columbus, built by William Stone, in September,
     1838. He abandoned his town the next spring, there being
     only a single log cabin. The site was that occupied by the
     present city of Cedar Rapids. The next was Ivanhoe, by Anson
     Cowles, in October, 1838, since vacated. The fourth was
     Marion, the present county seat, in April, 1839.

     "The first election was held at Westport in October, 1838,
     that being the only poll opened for the county. The only
     candidates were for members of the Assembly; thirty-two
     votes were cast. The first member of the General Assembly
     elected from this county was the Hon. George Greene, member
     of the Legislative Council, elected in 1840. The first store
     opened was at Westport, by Albert [John] Henry, in the fall
     of 1838. The second at Ivanhoe, in the spring of 1839, by
     Col. William H. Merritt.

     "The first celebration was on the 4th of July, 1839, at
     Westport, Judge Mitchell, Orator. There was a dinner,
     toasts, and a ball, whereof William H. Smith, Andrew J.
     McKean and H. W. Gray, were managers.

     "The fifth decennial census of the United States was taken
     in 1840, in this county, by H. W. Gray, Deputy Marshal. The
     population was 1,342. The influx of settlers for the next
     three years was quite rapid, during which time the
     population reached probably three thousand. The largest
     proportion of the emigration was of Southern origin. The
     early settlers were plain, honest, hospitable people, not
     much accustomed to legal restraints, and rather impatient of
     the slow process and technicalities of the law. As usual, in
     all new countries, they were annoyed by vagabonds, who
     flocked into the settlements, calculating on impunity in
     their depredations, on account of the inefficiency of the
     police regulations. A rude justice was not unfrequently
     meted out to offenders without recourse to legal forms, or
     the intervention of courts.

     "In common with all frontier settlements, the first settlers
     here were poor; they were obliged to transport their produce
     in wagons mostly, to the Mississippi River, at points sixty
     or seventy miles distant. When reached at such disadvantage
     the markets were very low, consequently the accretions of
     wealth were slow, and were mainly invested in the homestead
     of the farmer. The discovery of gold in California with the
     resulting emigration, opened a good market for the farmers
     at home. Afterwards, eastern emigration, with the building
     of railroads, connecting the people with eastern markets,
     greatly accelerated the prosperity of this county as well as
     all other parts of the west. The financial crisis of 1857
     interposed a check to this onward career of prosperity. It
     was but temporary, however, and the people had fully
     regained their former standing when the rebellion commenced.

     "It is felt that a county which contributed one general, and
     fifteen field officers, with more than two thousand
     volunteers in defense of the Union, without draft or
     conscription, and without seriously lessening its productive
     energies, has an assured basis of future greatness and
     prosperity. A basis which nothing short of the entire
     upheaval and destruction of the foundations of human society
     shall be able to disturb."

In _Guide, Gazetteer and Directory of the Dubuque & Sioux City
Railroad_, Dubuque, _Bailey & Wolfe_, 1868, we read of Cedar Rapids:

     "The first settlement here was made in the year 1838 by
     William Stone, who erected a log cabin on the bank of the
     river in the rear of No. 1 North Commercial street. The same
     year Osgood Shepherd, a supposed leader of a band of
     outlaws, jumped Stone's claim and took possession of the
     cabin, and held it until the year 1841, when he sold
     three-fourths of his interest to N. B. Brown and George
     Greene, H. W. Gray, A. L. Roach, and S. H. Tryon, for the
     sum of $3,000.

     "In 1842 he sold the remainder and soon after disappeared
     from the country. N. B. Brown came here in 1840, when Mr.
     Brown and Judge George Greene became proprietors of the
     water power.

     "In 1841 the town was laid out and named from the rapids in
     the river. The first frame dwelling was erected by John
     Vardy and is still standing at 62 Brown street, corner of
     South Adams. The building known as the Old Postoffice
     Building, North Washington street, was built for a store by
     N. B. Brown, the same year. P. W. Earle's residence, 29 Iowa
     Avenue, was the first brick building, and was erected by Mr.
     Earle in 1849. Wm. Dwyer built the first hotel in 1847. This
     was destroyed by fire in January, 1865.

     "The work of constructing a dam across the river, was
     commenced by N. B. Brown, July 4th, 1842, though much of the
     material had been prepared prior to that date. Mr. Brown
     commenced the erection of a saw mill, and also of a grist
     mill the same year, and both were completed the year
     following. A second saw mill was built in 1851.

     "The second flouring mill was built by Alexander Ely in
     1844-5. The first woolen factory was also built by N. B.
     Brown in 1847. In 1855 a city charter was obtained, and at
     the first charter election, Isaac N. Whittam was elected
     Mayor. Railroad communication with the Mississippi was
     opened in 1859, from which time the growth of the city in
     wealth and population has been rapid and constant.

     "A superior water power has attracted a large interest in
     manufactures of various kinds. As early as 1840 one of the
     first settlers determined to apply his energies to the
     improvement of the water power, and soon after a dam was
     thrown across the river, a saw mill built, and other
     improvements followed, till now there are located here five
     flouring and custom mills, one saw mill, one paper mill, two
     woolen mills, and one fanning mill and separator
     manufactory."




CHAPTER VII

_William Abbe, the First Settler in the County_


William Abbe, we believe, was the first white settler to locate a claim
within the boundaries of Linn county. He came as early as the summer of
1836, from near Elyria, Lorain county, Ohio, seeking a location, coming
via Rock Island. He followed the Red Cedar river as far as the present
site of Mount Vernon, where he staked out a claim adjoining a little
creek, which to this day goes by the name of "Abbe's Creek." He
returned to his home in Ohio and in the winter of 1837 he again crossed
the Mississippi with his family on the ice as early as February of that
year, according to his daughter's statement, and in April reached the
location he had selected the previous year on Abbe's creek. Here he
erected one of the first cabins in the county, being about 12x14 feet
square, and covered with birch bark, having no floor. In this little
cabin the family lived all summer. In the fall he erected a large
double log house with three large rooms and an upstairs which was
reached by a ladder from within. On this creek the family lived for
five years where Mr. Abbe owned four hundred acres. He disposed of this
farm and removed a short distance south of Marion where he purchased
another farm where he lived till he removed to Marion.

William Abbe was born in Connecticut April 19, 1800, being of English
descent. When a young boy he removed to the state of New York. He was
married to Olive Greene in 1824 and by her had four children: Lucy,
Lois, Andrew, and Susan. Lois Abbe died young, Lucy Abbe died many
years ago, Andrew Abbe passed away at San Juan, California, in 1902,
and Susan Abbe-Shields now resides at Hollister, California.

William Abbe brought his wife and children to Linn county in 1837; his
wife died in 1839 and was buried in a cemetery located near the farm on
which he settled, about two miles northwest of Mount Vernon. He married
a second time on September 13, 1840, his wife being Mary Wolcott, also
from Ohio, and by her he had two sons, born at Marion: Augustus Wolcott
Abbe and William Alden Abbe. William Alden Abbe died several years ago;
his widow and one child, a daughter, reside in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
Augustus Wolcott Abbe, an old soldier, resides in Toledo, Iowa, and has
a family of eight children.

Mrs. Susan Shields was born in 1830 and was about seven years of age
when she came to Linn county. She was married to John Harman March 16,
1848, who died shortly afterwards, and she later married John Shields,
a resident of Vinton, Iowa. In an interesting letter on early Linn
county days she writes as follows:

     "There were no white people for a long time after we landed
     in Linn county; when they did come my mother used to let
     them come and stay there until they would find a place to
     suit them; it was always a free home for the immigrants.
     When we first went there I was but a child seven years old.
     The men I remember most were Robert Ellis, one of our first
     acquaintances, and Asher Edgerton, the former being with us
     a long time when the country was new. Of course we had men
     come in, such as horse thieves, and my father had some of
     them chained up in one of our rooms for safe keeping until
     they could be tried, as there was no jail for some time in
     Linn county.

     "I went with my father to Marion, a little place then with
     one or two houses and a jail. We carried an iron trap door
     for the jail; it was in two rooms, one upstairs and one
     downstairs. There were two men in the dungeon at the time;
     we took the door for this jail. My father was a justice of
     the peace for awhile; he was also a member of the state
     legislature when the capital was located at Iowa City. Later
     father sold our place on Abbe's Creek and purchased another
     on the old Marion road, of about three hundred acres,
     further north; there was a lovely creek, a grove of maple
     trees was on one side and a boundless prairie on the other
     side. The Indians used to come in the spring of the year to
     camp and make sugar; I have seen as many as five or six
     hundred at a time camped near our house in the timber; they
     always made it a camping ground at our place and they seemed
     to be very fond of my father, who was kind to them and who
     spoke and understood the Winnebago language.

     "I remember well the first time I went to Cedar Rapids with
     my father; this was in the early '40s; there were five
     hundred Winnebago Indians camped there at the time. I had
     played with the Indians so much that I could talk the Indian
     language as well as themselves, so they had me to talk for
     them. There were only one or two white settlers there at the
     time. By the way, I was the first school teacher they had in
     Cedar Rapids; I think it was about in 1846; I still have the
     certificate issued to me by Alexander Ely, who was
     superintendent at the time. After residing on this place a
     short time my father disposed of his farm and removed to
     Marion; he also lived for some time at Dubuque where he held
     a government position in the Land Office, I think. The
     breaking out of the gold fever in 1849 caused him to get
     excited and he left for California, leaving the family at
     Marion.

     "My father was a born pioneer; although born in Connecticut
     he went to New York when the country was new, and then to
     Ohio, and later came to Iowa. In California he never mined
     gold, but teamed and speculated; he was there about two
     years, returning to Iowa in 1851, remaining in Iowa only a
     short time when he returned to California with his son,
     Andrew. My father died in Sacramento, California, February
     15, 1854, when about to go to Iowa to bring his family to
     California, and he is buried in Sacramento."

This interesting letter from a real Linn county pioneer more than
seventy years of age gives only an idea of the hardships of pioneer
life, and what this woman has endured as a daughter and wife of the
first settlers.

William Abbe's widow, Mary Wolcott, continued to reside in Marion with
her family until August 27, 1861, when she died, universally respected
by all who knew her.

Mr. Abbe was an old time democrat and as such was in the state senate
session, having the honor to appoint Robert Ellis postmaster of the
senate, as a reward of friendship and good will. Mr. Abbe also was a
justice of the peace for some time, was appointed commissioner to
locate state roads, had the contract for the erection of the first jail
at Marion, and was otherwise a very useful citizen. He was also master
of the first Masonic lodge at Marion, and one of the best known and
best educated men in Linn county up to the time of his removal to
California. For a number of years Mr. Abbe was the only person in the
county having ready money, loaning the same to his friends for the
purchase of their claims. He held government contracts for the delivery
of meat and provisions to the Winnebago agency at Fort Atkinson and to
the troops at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, and at other places, and
thus was acquainted with many of the military officers in the Black
Hawk war and with the Indian chiefs and braves of the Winnebago tribe,
as well as the Sac and Fox Indians. It is said that William Abbe
conversed freely with the Winnebago Indians, and frequently acted as an
interpreter when matters of importance came up between members of the
tribe and the white settlers; he was always a friend and protector of
the Indians and frequently helped them in securing their just rights
when they had been robbed by the white free-booters, hunters and
trappers.

[Illustration: FORMER PASTORS UNITED BRETHREN CHURCH, LISBON]

William Abbe was a kind and generous man, and his home was always open
to the people who came into Linn county at an early day to seek homes.
It is also said that Mrs. Abbe was an excellent cook and many of the
old surveyors would ride several miles out of their way to get a meal
at the Abbe homestead, for the latch string of the Abbe home was always
out.

Mr. Abbe rode horseback a great deal and would be gone for weeks at a
time, and while he was away the family lived quietly at home awaiting
for days for his return when provisions were frequently scarce and when
the snow drifts generally were large. During the first two seasons
there were very few crops grown, and consequently the father was kept
busy earning a livelihood, the family subsisting mostly on the chase.
He traded provisions with the Indians, at times bringing home large
quantities of honey which was used as sugar in sweetening black coffee
as well as in place of butter on the hard johnny cake.

His son, Augustus Abbe, born on Abbe's creek in 1841, later a member of
the 9th Iowa Infantry, now a retired farmer residing at Toledo, Iowa,
tells the following of his father's life and history:

     "There was not a time in my life when I do not remember the
     Indian children. I played with them constantly. Those were
     my only playmates in the early days. I learned a little of
     the Winnebago language, and got along very well. My half
     sister, Susan, spoke it fluently, as well as my father. I
     remember when I was about five or six years old a number of
     Indians were gathered in our house and I climbed a post,
     sitting on the same to watch the redskins race their horses.
     One of the chiefs, one that had the most gaudy clothing on,
     rode by very fast and picked me off the post and put me in
     front on his saddle, going at full gallop; he rode a long
     ways down through the prairie and my mother expressed much
     anxiety, but my father came out and stood there and watched
     for me to return. After awhile the Indian came back and put
     me safely down in front of the house, to my mother's joy--I,
     all the time laughing, thinking that I had had a good time.
     The Indian said to my father, 'papoose no 'fraid.' That pony
     ride I shall remember as long as I live.

     "I also remember my father going away for two or three weeks
     at a time, and my mother fixing up his lunch for the
     journey. He had a pair of saddle bags filled with papers and
     other articles. I still remember when he put on moccasins,
     overshoes, and a buffalo overcoat of some kind; he would
     bundle up securely, kiss us good-bye and start off across
     the prairie at full speed. Many a time I cried, as I wanted
     to go along, but on these long journeys I was refused this
     pleasure for my father would not neglect business even for
     the sake of pleasing his son whom he loved dearly.

     "I also remember Robert Ellis, the Ashertons, Willitts,
     Clarks, and many others who came to our house and talked way
     into the night about trips they had taken over the wide
     prairies of Iowa. Our cabin was full of people most of the
     time; they would come in late in the night and in the
     morning, much to my surprise, I would find a number of
     people at breakfast, I not knowing when they came during the
     night. I never knew or heard of my mother making any charge
     for keeping anyone over night, whether they were strangers
     or acquaintances, whether they were poor or rich made no
     difference; whatever she had she would divide with a
     traveller or other stranger who came to her hospitable home.

     "I do not know that my mother understood much of the Indian
     language, but she was kind to them and the squaws used to
     sit on our door steps more than once. She gave them food
     that she had prepared, sweetened with honey which they liked
     very much.

     "I remember going to Marion with my father many times when
     it was a very small village with a jail which my father
     always pointed out as having built. He also taught me that I
     must do right or else I might have to stay in that jail or
     some other jail if I did not. These lessons were certainly
     deeply impressed on me for life. I remember, also, when we
     removed from Marion to Dubuque. I think that was in 1847,
     and we remained there for some time, but I think less than a
     year, when we removed back to Marion. My father held a
     government position there in the land office, I think.

     "My two uncles, Charles and Eliezar Abbe, resided in Ohio,
     one later removing to Michigan. The latter visited my father
     frequently. He was related, also, on his wife's side, to Ed
     Clark, an early settler in Linn county. These men were much
     taken up with the country and we had hoped that they would
     come here to locate, but they did not.

     "I also, with my father, visited Cedar Rapids many times,
     and I do not believe I was more than five or six years of
     age, hardly that, when I first saw Cedar Rapids, where I was
     much interested in the dam and the mills. The town then
     consisted of a few log houses along the east bank of the
     river. The remainder of the town was a mass of sand burrs,
     weeds, and timber, and along Cedar Lake and along the river
     large numbers of Indians were camped, especially up along
     the Cedar Lake and along what is now known as McCloud's
     Springs. In this locality several hundred Indians would camp
     in the winter and spring of the year, trapping, hunting, and
     trading skins with the whites for red clothing, guns, and
     ammunition. They would hang around the flour mills during
     the day time where there were always a lot of people
     gathered.

     "My mother was a member of the Lutheran church, which church
     she now and then attended, but there were not many churches
     in that day. My father was not a church member.

     "I remember my sister, Susan, teaching one of the first
     schools in Cedar Rapids, much to the satisfaction of the
     members of our family. In politics my father was a stanch
     democrat and an admirer of Andrew Jackson. He also became
     acquainted with most of the officers who remained in the
     west after the close of the Black Hawk war, on account of
     his government employment in which he was engaged. He was
     also personally acquainted with the persons who had charge
     of the Winnebago school, as well as those in charge of Fort
     Atkinson. Nearly all the people who rode horseback from Iowa
     City to Dubuque came by way of Mount Vernon, and would
     generally stop over night at our home. I remember my father
     and the strangers talking over politics until way into the
     night, and still remember many of these discussions as to
     the future of Iowa and as to the political aspirations of
     the various parties. My father took a lively interest in
     politics, as well as in the development of the west, and
     when it was settled up he had a longing for starting another
     pioneer settlement. He used to say when the land was pretty
     much taken that it was too close, he had to get away, as he
     wanted more room. By training and environment he was a true
     pioneer and full of enthusiasm for the upbuilding of a
     pioneer country.

     "When he was away in California we were much interested in
     his letters and we all wanted to go. When our father
     returned we asked him all sorts of questions about the gold
     camps of the west, and what he had experienced, and we spent
     whole evenings listening to his conversations. He did not
     take us at that time, but wanted to seek out an ideal
     location and get settled before he took us out there. But
     the day never came, and we never saw him again when he left
     on his second trip to California in 1852. All that we knew
     was that my mother received a letter from a Masonic order in
     Sacramento that the order had taken care of him in his
     sickness and had seen that he received a suitable burial. He
     was sick only a short time and none of his old friends was
     with him when he died. Robert Ellis came to Sacramento
     looking for his old neighbor and heard to his sorrow that
     his friend had died only a week before. He came into
     Sacramento from the camps on the American river.

     "After my father's death my mother resided in Marion with
     her family where she died August 27, 1861, at the age of
     fifty-eight years. As I felt downhearted at the time I
     joined the army and went to the front. November 29, 1865, I
     was joined in marriage to Cynthia Walker, daughter of an old
     Linn county pioneer.

     "My father was also sheriff of Linn county. However, of this
     there does not seem to be any record, as I have been
     informed. He may have been appointed sheriff to fill a
     vacancy, or he may have been a deputy, I am not certain
     about that, but I know he was acting, at least, in the
     capacity of sheriff and caused the arrest of a number of
     horse thieves and other alleged criminals. My father was
     over six feet tall, straight as an arrow, rather slender,
     but very active, and I never saw a horse that he could not
     mount and ride at any time without the least effort.

     "We used cattle for plowing, but generally kept also several
     horses, but these were used to drive and ride and not to
     work very much.

     "I believe that among the early settlers of the '30s and
     '40s my father had the good will of all law-abiding
     citizens. He was affable to strangers and true as steel to
     his friends, and was universally respected."

William Abbe will be remembered as one of the most prominent of his day
and generation in Linn county, for his kindness, his uprightness, his
never wavering from the path of right. Whether amid the influences of
the home circle or surrounded by the temptations of the mining camp, he
was always the same sturdy, upright citizen, wanting to do right and
helping his fellow men who were more unfortunate than himself.

One of his old and true friends, speaking of his long deceased friend,
expressed words of deepest feeling which can be only expressed in the
well known stanzas:

     "Green be the turf above thee,
       Friend of my better days,
     None knew thee but to love thee,
       None named thee but to praise."

While a great many are now of the opinion that William Abbe was the
first actual settler within the confines of Linn county, a number are
still of the opinion that Daniel Seward Hahn was the first settler. He
came here, accompanied by his wife, Parmelia Epperson Hahn. John J.
Daniels, an old settler in Linn county, and a son of Jeremiah Daniels,
who came to Linn county in 1844, was pretty good authority on the
subject of the early settlers. In a number of conversations had with
him on this subject and from what he wrote for the _Annals of Iowa_,
Vol. VI, p. 581, and for the Iowa _Atlas_, 1907, it is gathered that he
was of the opinion that Daniel Hahn was the first actual settler, at
least the members of the Hahn family, of whom there are a number still
living in Linn and adjoining counties, claim that their ancestor,
Daniel Hahn, should be awarded the honor. In the _Annals of Iowa_ Mr.
Daniels has the following:

     "Daniel Hahn and his brother-in-law, Charles Moberly, came
     to Linn county in the spring of 1837, made a claim and built
     a cabin upon it, did some breaking, and in August removed
     with wife and five children from Mercer county, Illinois. At
     this time there was no house in Linn county to his
     knowledge."

This, Mr. Daniels says, was the statement made to him and others in the
lifetime of Daniel Hahn.

This may be true, that in the early day very little, if any, social
intercourse was had among the early settlers and no one paid any
attention to time or place, and it might be that Mr. Abbe, Mr. Hahn,
and Mr. Crow might have settled at the same time, one never having
known that the others had located here.

Quoting from Mr. Daniels's articles, the following might be stated:

     "Edward M. Crow came to the county in July, 1837, in company
     with his brother, locating near Viola where they made a
     claim and erected a shanty; they remained there only a few
     days, returning to Fox river to obtain provisions, having
     decided to locate in the county. In the latter part of
     August Edward Crow and his brother and James Dawson began to
     work on their new possessions; about this time there came
     also two other pioneers by the name of Joslyn and Russell;
     they remained in the crude cabin during the winter and their
     time was spent mostly in hunting, tanning pelts and trading
     with the Indians. Their cabin was erected at the edge of
     what was known as the 'Big Woods' in Brown township."

Thus it would seem that William Abbe in point of time was the first
actual white settler to locate a claim and later to settle on this
claim with his family, within the confines of Linn county. True,
hunters and trappers may have been here earlier, but no actual _bona
fide_ settler, as far as we have been able to ascertain. The testimony
of Mrs. Susan Shields, a daughter still living, would seem to suffice
as to the time when the great river was crossed and as to the time the
family came to Linn county.

CHAPTER VIII

_The County Seat Contests--First Railroad in the County_


The county seat of Linn county was established at Marion by a board of
commissioners consisting of Lyman Dillon, Ben Nye, and Richard Knott.
As the years rolled by the question arose as to the removal of the
county seat to Cedar Rapids, where it seems that it was needed, being
what was then known as the commercial metropolis of the county. The
people of Marion insisted that that city was the center. While there
was more or less feeling in the county over the county seat fight, the
legislature of Iowa in 1850-51 created the office of county judge,
which was designed to and did succeed the former legislative bodies of
the several counties of the state. The judge had the same powers
possessed by the board of supervisors which controlled the affairs of
the county later. Among the rights and privileges peculiar to the
office was that most important one of submitting to the people the
question of raising money for the purpose of repairing and erecting
buildings for the use of the county officers. (See Code of 1851.)

In 1855 James M. Berry was county judge, and a shrewd fellow he was. In
pursuance of the law, and what he thought his duty, Judge Berry took
steps to erect a jail and a fireproof building for the use of the
county officers. These buildings were contracted for by a firm at Mt.
Vernon, Ohio, in the spring of that year. Then the people arose in arms
as to the high-handed methods of Judge Berry. Political questions were
lost sight of in the court house struggle. Speakers were employed pro
and con. Judge Berry's term of office expired January 1, 1856, and a
successor was to be elected in August of 1855. Marion put up Judge
Berry for re-election, while Cedar Rapids put up Rev. Elias Skinner, a
well known Methodist preacher who had traveled about the county and who
was well known by everyone as an aggressive fighter and a man who
believed in what he did and would have things his way if possible. The
canvass was in the aggregate with Judge Berry at 1,233 votes, while
Skinner showed up with 993 votes, the judge being re-elected by a
majority of 240 votes, thereby affirming by a referendum vote his
policy.

Reverend Skinner is still living at Waterloo, and not long ago the
writer had a conversation with him about this the most famous fight
that has ever occurred in Linn county over the removal of the court
house. Mr. Skinner just laughed and said he put up a good fight, but
the other fellow had the votes.

In 1871 another court house fight was had, but the board held that
because of many names of voters being on both petitions these petitions
were defective.

In the spring of 1872 another petition was brought out for the
re-location of the court house and an endless number of names were
again filed pro and con. Much money was spent on both sides; again the
Cedar Rapids faction was beaten, some preliminary steps were taken for
an appeal but the appeal was stricken from the docket.

Another attempt was made by Cedar Rapids for a change of location of
the court house a few years ago, and again the petitioners lost out,
and that case has been pending on the court docket but no action has
been taken, so that it has for the fourth time been lost, much to the
surprise of the citizens of Cedar Rapids and to the satisfaction of the
people of Marion and a large portion of the northern part of the county
who have always stood out for Marion in the fights on the re-location
of the county seat.


THE FIRST RAILROAD IN LINN COUNTY

While it may have been charged at times that Iowa was slow in getting
in touch with railway builders, it must be borne in mind that the first
railroad to be built in the United States upon which a steam engine was
used was constructed in 1829; but very little was done until about
1833-34. By 1835 there were not over 100 miles of road in active
operation within the confines of the entire country. Up to 1841 not a
mile of track had been laid in any of the following states: Ohio,
Indiana, Illinois, Michigan. By the end of 1848 there were only
twenty-two miles of tracks laid in Illinois, eighty-six in Indiana, and
none in Wisconsin or Missouri.

Traffic so far had been exclusively by river, lake, canal, or in
wagons. Much money had been expended in opening up rivers for steamboat
traffic and more or less had been voted to build roads and dig canals.
But over such a large stretch of country it was impossible for the
nation to do much.

As early as 1837 many citizens of Iowa and others began to agitate for
a transcontinental line of railroad to run from the Atlantic states to
the Pacific, and for a grant of land by congress for this purpose. Asa
Whitney, of New York, an able and public spirited man, had written much
in the papers proposing such a project. There was of course at that
time more or less speculation as to just where such proposed railroad
might pass. The southern senators proposed a road through St. Louis and
across Missouri to Kansas. There was a spirit of rivalry at this time.
When Chicago began to get its growth the far-sighted people of that
city saw that it would be in the interests of Chicago to have the line
go directly west and through Iowa, and thus cut out a dangerous rival.

The Chicago press henceforth always favored a direct route through
Iowa. As early as 1838 G. W. Jones, then delegate in congress from
Wisconsin, secured an appropriation of $10,000, which was expended in
making a survey from Lake Michigan through southern Wisconsin.

Now the people of Iowa became active. They wanted a railroad from the
lakes west, and this could only be secured by public or state aid. The
legislature of 1844 joined in a petition to congress asking a grant of
public land to the Territory of Iowa to aid in the construction of a
railroad from Dubuque to Keokuk. The grant was to consist of alternate
sections extending five miles in width on each of the proposed roads or
its equivalent in adjacent government lands.

During the winter of 1844-45 a convention was held at Iowa City where
nearly all the counties of the territory were represented by wide-awake
young men in the interest of this railway promotion. Several proposed
lines were agitated and as some of these lines did not start at any
place and went to no place many of these projects failed.

The first grant of public lands in Iowa for transportation was not for
railroads but for improving navigation on the Des Moines river. It was
made in 1846. Strong then was the prejudice against railway promotion,
and little faith did the public men in congress put in this so-called
wild speculation.

The people of Iowa were so enthusiastic in the way of railway building
and in the promotion of enterprises that they even ignored old
political standards. It would appear that when the subject of the
training of the candidates was looked into it, it depended more on what
use such person would be for the work of getting a railway grant than
how he would vote on the tariff or on the rights of South Carolina.

The following letter, written May 28, 1848, by W. H. Merritt to S. W.
Durham, an old friend and fellow democrat, shows plainly the attitude
of one of the leading men of the party, then living at Dubuque, but who
had formerly resided at Ivanhoe and hence was one of the early men in
Linn county. He mentions Preston (Colonel Isaac Preston), and gives his
reasons for not wanting him. The Leffingwell mentioned was the
well-known W. E. Leffingwell, who formerly resided at Muscatine, then
Bloomington, and later removed to Clinton county. He was an eloquent
lawyer and a popular man. He was later defeated by William Smyth for
congress in this district. Bates and Folsom were both prominent Iowa
City men, and well known in political circles for many years. Judge
Grant was the noted jurist of Davenport, and was a well-known railroad
promoter who had much influence in early years in Iowa.

In this letter Mr. Merritt suggests George Greene as a candidate from
Linn county. There is no doubt that if at this time Mr. Greene had been
selected, he would have carried the district and made an enviable
record as a statesman, and no doubt on account of his judgment and his
keenness in business, he would have obtained from congress such favors
as would have amounted to much good for Iowa in the first stages of her
statehood. The letter does not show whether or not Mr. Greene had
consented or would consent to such a course, although it has been
stated that he most likely would have consented to have made the
canvass. For congress the whigs nominated this year, 1848, D. F. Miller
for the first district and Tim Davis for the second district. The
democrats nominated for the first district William Thompson, and for
the second district Shepherd Leffler. The whigs were strong, the total
vote for president at the November elections being, Cass, democrat,
12,093; Taylor, whig, 11,144; Van Buren, free soiler, 1,126.

Leffler was elected, and Miller on a close vote contested the election
of Thompson before congress. The committee on elections declared the
seat vacant. Leffler, who was elected after an exciting canvass, was a
native of Pennsylvania, who came to Iowa Territory in 1835. He sat in
the first constitutional convention in 1844, and two years later was
elected to congress by the state at large, and hence in 1848 he had the
inside track. In 1856 he was again a candidate but was defeated by Tim
Davis, his old whig opponent of 1848. In 1875 he was a candidate for
governor against S. J. Kirkwood, and was defeated. He died at
Burlington in 1879. He had been one of the trusted leaders of his party
for many years.

The letters from W. H. Merritt and George Greene show what interest
these men had in the railroad enterprise.

LETTER FROM MERRITT

     "Strictly confidential.
                                      Dubuque, May 28, 1848.
     "Friend Durham:

     "Having retired from the editorial tripod I find more time
     to devote to my friends in the reflective and agreeable
     exercise of correspondence than formerly. Since my second
     return to Iowa it would have been highly gratifying to my
     feelings had I been so situated in business as to have
     employed a portion of my time in personal communication with
     my friends, in viewing scenes connected with the early
     settlement of Iowa, and in witnessing the numerous monuments
     reared to attest the prevailing, the restless and resistless
     enterprise of the Anglo-American. In 1838, when I first
     pitched my tent at Ivanhoe, Linn county had but few white
     inhabitants, possessed but few attractions for one
     accustomed to the society of one of the old Federal
     colonies, and was entirely destitute of political or
     judicial organization. Everything that the eye could behold
     appeared in a rude state of nature. Vast prairies which
     extended for miles presented no evidences of civilization,
     no familiar sound like that of the woodman's axe appeared to
     interrupt the solemn stillness of an uninhabited wilderness.
     The marks of wild beasts and wild men were now and then
     visible and the similitude was striking between the two, as
     though both were born to the same sphere of action and
     subject to the same laws of being. A sort of wildness and
     sacred stillness seemed to pervade the whole atmosphere.
     Reclining upon a buffalo robe in my tent, reflecting upon
     the varied scenery without and quietly listening to the
     solemn murmurs of the Cedar, I thought I could perceive
     visions of earthly happiness for the man of true genius
     nowhere else to be found. The longer I remained upon the
     spot, the more it endeared itself to my affections, and the
     less I thought of cultivated society and the dazzling
     beauties of wealth, and its primeval companion, aristocracy.
     Nature seemed to be decked in her nuptial dress and wild
     beasts danced to and fro with a festive heart to the
     harmonious notes of a troop of forest birds.

     "Circumstances forced me to leave that consecrated spot
     after a year's residence, and once more become a victim to
     the cold restraints and relentless laws of civilization. For
     five years was I bound by stern necessity to a habitation
     worse than a prison, and associated with men as little to be
     admired for their social qualities of character as the
     cannibals of old. To be engaged in merchandising among a
     people whose only article of faith was 'cheat and grow
     rich,' and whose friendship could be secured only by
     corrupting the morals and lacerating the heart of the
     innocent, was a pursuit little to be desired by one whose
     heart had been consecrated to a different field of
     enterprise and nourished by the sacred impulses of the West.
     Be assured I escaped from this thralldom as soon as I could,
     and never to this hour has my mind enjoyed that repose that
     it did when seated upon the banks of the Cedar and
     surrounded by the beautiful scenery of Ivanhoe. I
     experienced a kind of maternal affection for the spot, a
     mystic tie instinctively chains my mind to its early
     history, and a magic like that which bound Blennerhasset to
     his favorite island in the Ohio seems to pervade every
     recollection connected with its name and its founder.

     "But I must abandon this subject, or I shall trespass upon
     the time and space designed for another, and convert what
     was intended for a political letter into a literary bore. As
     you manifested a friendly solicitude when here that I should
     take up my residence in Linn county when my studies were
     finished, I thought it not out of place to remind you where
     my inclination would lead me.

     "I would speak privately to you upon the subject of a
     candidate for congress in this district. I understand that
     Mr. Preston of Linn is to be a candidate; that Leffler will
     be a candidate; Leffingwell of Bloomington and Bates and
     Folsom of Iowa City. Leffler I do not believe can be
     nominated. I think he has acted in bad faith with his
     constituents. Leffingwell has no chance, although he has the
     untiring vigilance of S. C. Hastings to support him. Preston
     I fear has no chance. He is deceived by Hastings and I fear
     erroneously counts upon the delegation from Dubuque. We have
     appointed eight delegates. I am one. I have spoken to them
     all and find that every man is in favor of giving the
     nomination to Linn County for the reason that the interest
     of Linn is identical with that of Dubuque in properly
     agitating and ultimately constructing the Railroad from this
     to Keokuk, but they will not support Preston because they
     have no confidence in his ability.

     "One thing is very certain, Friend Durham, and that is that
     we must elect a man who is identified with this great
     railroad improvement. Preston would no doubt do all in his
     power, but he fails to unite that confidence in his favor
     necessary to give him the nomination. Leffler would no doubt
     do what he has done, give Davenport the preference.
     Leffingwell as a matter of course would feel but little
     personal interest in a railroad running through the interior
     of the state and forty or fifty miles removed from his
     immediate constituency, to whom he is more nearly allied and
     intimately associated in political friendship. All residing
     upon the banks of the Mississippi and in its immediate
     vicinity, except those at Keokuk and this point, are opposed
     to any grant by Congress for this railroad, and I can hardly
     conceive that it reflects any dishonor upon them as a
     community or as private individuals, for they are no doubt
     influenced like all men from natural and selfish impulses.
     But with Mr. Leffler the case is far different. He was
     elected to represent the wishes and interests of one entire
     community of people, eight-tenths of whom have a direct and
     vital interest in the success of this enterprise. He is
     requested and repeatedly urged by petition and memorial to
     give it his earnest support. But he pays no regard to their
     solicitations until a scheme in which he is more directly
     interested is matured, forwarded to him, and he puts it upon
     its passage through Congress. At least six weeks before a
     single step was taken in aid of the Davenport road in this
     state, petitions were forwarded to Mr. Leffler for the
     Dubuque and Keokuk road. In truth no move was made for the
     Davenport road until Judge Grant returned from Washington
     City, which was some twelve days after the Legislature had
     convened, and after the petition had gone from this place,
     Cascade, from your town, a memorial from the legislature,
     and the convention had been held at Iowa City, at which, if
     I mistake not, you were present. Under this state of facts I
     cannot but regard Mr. Leffler as hostile to this road, in
     which case our delegation cannot support his claim.

[Illustration: SOME EARLY MEMBERS UNITED BRETHREN CHURCH, LISBON]

     "As to Bates and Folsom of Iowa City, we regard them as
     feeling an equal interest in both roads, both proposing to
     pass through Iowa City. Under these circumstances what
     policy does it become us to adopt? Emphatically to select a
     candidate upon the proposed line of road. Can you not bring
     forward some man besides Preston? Mr. Boothe and some three
     or four of our leading men have suggested to me that if Linn
     county should bring forward G. G. [George Greene], he would
     get the nomination and be elected by an overwhelming
     majority. Mr. G. is absent and I know not whether it would
     suit him if conferred. He is in feeling and interest
     emphatically a Linn County man, but whether such a proposal
     would strike him favorably or meet with his sanction are
     questions which I am unable to solve. I think if sent to
     Congress he would be a working man and would be very active
     towards procuring an appropriation for the said road. He
     feels, as does every Linn county man, a very deep interest
     in the enterprise. I wish you would give this subject a
     candid investigation and then write me upon the subject.

     "I have been solicited to become a candidate for the
     Legislature. I have peremptorily declined. I feel no
     particular aspirations for office. I desire to give my time
     to the study of the law. You will recollect that I have
     introduced the name of Mr. Greene to your notice without his
     knowledge and entirely upon my own responsibility.

     "Our families are all well. Mr. Greene has been absent
     between three and four weeks. Remember me to all friends and
     believe me, your obedient servant and faithful friend,

                                        WM. H. MERRITT.

     "P. S.--Will you be so kind as to inform Wm. Greene that Mr.
     Bonson is anxiously waiting for that two yoke of oxen, which
     George contracted with him for. He wants them immediately.

                                 Respectfully yours,
                                      "WM. H. MERRITT."

Mr. Merritt was a man of ability and prominent in the democratic party
up to the time of his death. As candidate for governor in 1861, against
S. J. Kirkwood, with four other candidates claiming to run on the
democratic platform, Mr. Merritt received 43,245 votes out of a total
vote cast of 108,700. This testifies to Mr. Merritt's popularity among
the people of Iowa.

LETTER FROM GEORGE GREENE

                                 "Dubuque, March 3, 1847.

     "Dear Durham:

     "I find that I cannot without great injury to my business
     here, leave until next week; but still I am very anxious to
     see the work go on. If you like my suggestion of finishing
     Jo's [Joseph Greene] contract first in order to expedite the
     arrival of the money it will be as well to have Wm. [Greene]
     send Andrew or some other person out to bring the field
     notes in. I propose the finishing of Jo's first because it
     can be done soonest. It will not require so long to plat the
     work in the S. G.'s office, and it will not interfere with
     the operations of Mr. Ross, who will take the field at the
     time, or soon after, you do. He wrote Mr. Wiltse that he
     should return to the work as soon as the snow decayed
     sufficient to justify. If any, he has done but very little
     in the T.s south of the one you have to correct. You may get
     any one you please to go out in my or Jo's place at our
     expense. The weather may not suffer you to start out before
     I come down, which I think will be early next week. You will
     take my horse, wagon, or anything else of mine that you may
     need. Mr. Wiltse thinks you had better make all your
     calculations before going upon the ground. He thinks you can
     do it more correctly and with a great saving of time and
     expense.

     "If you should consider it necessary you can employ Major
     McKean to go in our place; though I should think Andrew or
     some other good hand will do as well. If you should see fit
     to adopt my plan I will be at Cedar Rapids at the time the
     notes reach there and will bring them on immediately to
     Dubuque. Out of the money first received we will of course
     pay off the balance of the expenses of the surveys. You can
     show this to Wm. and Jos.

                                 "Yours truly
                                       GEO. GREENE.

The following is a report of the railroad meeting held at Marion in
1850 in which nearly all the public-spirited men of the city took part:

RAILROAD MEETING, MARION, NOVEMBER 30, 1850

     Meeting called to order by appointing P. W. Earle chairman
     and J. Green, secretary.

     On motion of W. Smythe, Esq., Resolved that a committee be
     appointed to report names of delegates to attend the State
     Rail Road Convention to be held at Iowa City on the
     .......... day of December next.

     Committee appointed by chair, H. W. Gray, Sausman, Dr. Ely,
     Hill of Putnam, Ashlock, Griffin, Mills of Marion.

     Maj. McKean was called for to address the meeting. He
     proceeded to do so in an appropriate address.

     On motion of Hon. G. Greene, Resolved that the delegates
     appointed to attend the State Rail Road Convention form
     themselves into a Rail Road Association and draft articles of
     said association for the advancement of the Dubuque & Keokuk
     Rail Road.

     The committee appointed to report names of delegates to
     attend State Convention through H. W. Gray report the names
     of the following persons as delegates:

     T. J. McKean, Hon. G. Greene, Dr. Jacob Williams, W. P.
     Harman, Esq., Ed. Railsback, Mr. Steadman, E. D. Waln,

     place of W. Smythe, Esq., adopted.

     On motion of I. Cook, Esq., If any fail to attend they
     appoint a substitute.

     On motion of Dr. Carpenter, Resolved that the secretary
     inform absent delegates of their appointment.

     On motion of Hon. G. Greene, Resolved that the delegates
     shall assemble in a separate convention if they shall deem
     expedient after the action of the State Convention to advance
     the interest of the Dubuque & Keokuk Rail Road.

     Messrs. Cook, Esq., and Hon. G. Greene being called for,
     addressed the meeting in appropriate addresses.

     On motion the meeting adjourned.

                                       J. GREENE, Secretary.

The getting of a railroad into Cedar Rapids then was the much talked of
scheme, and many people believed that this would also end in failure as
many other paper railroads had ended before. But the men at the head of
this company were men who had a standing in the financial world and
were in touch with the big banks of the country. They did not rely on
the taxes voted or on empty promises, for if these failed they would
still go on with the work. It is needless to add that this company,
like all others, got as much tax as possible and changed the location
of the route according to the amounts of bonuses offered. When the road
entered Cedar Rapids it was the beginning and the end in the long
struggle for railroad supremacy in the county, and decided for all
times the supremacy of the river city over the county seat. The latter
without a railway could do nothing more than sit down and wait till
such a time as some company saw fit to extend a line across the state
through other points.

For the air line known as the Iowa Central Air Line, the citizens of
Linn county voted in June, 1853, the sum of $200,000 to aid in the
construction of the road. In 1856 congress voted a grant of land to the
state of Iowa to aid in the construction of four roads across it,
including one on the line of this company. The legislature in extra
session conferred the land on this road in case it was completed. A
contract was let to a New York concern to complete the road to Marion,
a distance of eighty miles. On account of the financial crash in 1857
the contractors failed to raise the money and to go on with the work.
While the people were sore over this failure another company began
building from Clinton west and had completed forty miles during the
year 1858. It came as far as Lisbon by the end of this year, and this
was the first railroad station within the borders of Linn county.

The Dubuque and Southwestern was extended through to Cedar Rapids in
1865, just six years after the Northwestern road had laid its track to
the river and had trains running. This caused Cedar Rapids to become at
that early day a sort of railway center, and opened up a new territory
towards Dubuque. It was not a success financially till it was absorbed
by the Milwaukee road in May, 1878.

The following letter from one of the first employes will be of interest
in this connection:

                                 "Lamar, Mo., Sept. 5, 1910.

     "The Dubuque and Southwestern track was laid to Springville
     in the year 1859 or 1860. Mr. Jessup was president, and J.
     P. Farley, superintendent and manager. Mr. McConnell was
     road master. He owned a farm near Langworthy. I remember the
     first regular train was composed of one mail, express and
     baggage car combined, and one flat-top coach. The engine
     pulling the string was named 'Prairie King,' a little 14 by
     16 or 18 inch cylinder. The track was laid with about 50
     pound English T rail. The road had at this time three
     engines besides the 'Prairie King,' viz: the 'Prairie
     Queen,' still smaller than the King, the 'Anamosa,' and the
     'Monticello,' which was of the Rogers make of engines, the
     other three being of Mason manufacture. The conductor,
     Archie Cox, engineer, Ace Owens, and Baggagemaster Watson
     came to our house for supper and boarded with our folks
     until they could get accommodations at the Bruce house, and
     I went the next day on the train as the first newsboy. I
     was still newsboy when Vicksburg was taken. I then went to
     the army and stayed until after the war closed. I went on
     the road again after the war as fireman, brakeman, and
     baggageman. About 1870 I was promoted to conductor and
     stayed with the company until 1875. After Archie Cox quit
     the road Frank Farley took his place, and when the road was
     extended to Cedar Rapids, two or three years later, they put
     another train on, one leaving Cedar Rapids in the morning
     and one leaving Farley Junction in the morning. After they
     put on the second train Charley Farley was conductor of that
     train and George Farley was agent at the station at Cedar
     Rapids. Pat Cunningham was roadmaster for several years, and
     James Rollo was master mechanic and engineer for ten or
     twelve years. Our first stock cars were flat cars and when
     we got an order for a stock car we would take a flat car to
     the shop and put stakes and slats on in order to hold the
     stock while in transit.

                                         C. H. BRANCH."

One of the most important occurrences in the county was when on June
15, 1859, the first railroad made its entrance into Cedar Rapids and
once and for all made the town the chief city in this part of the
state.

This was accomplished after many failures and after much money had been
expended for surveys and in other ways. The following from men still
living, who remember the affair, will give the reader an idea as to how
jubilant all were on the day of this celebration:

George C. Haman was at that time running a drug store at about the same
location he has now. The corner of First avenue and First street was
then occupied by what was called Greene's hotel, and Mr. Haman occupied
a store room in the south side of the building. He remembers distinctly
the big celebration held in honor of the first train to arrive.

Mr. Haman said, as near as he could remember, that the town of Cedar
Rapids had a population of about 1,500 people at that time and a big
celebration was inaugurated and carried out. People from the
surrounding country came to town to see the train come in, and the
Indians on the reservation at Tama almost turned out enmasse to see the
great piece of machinery that they had heard so much about but had
never seen. The day was a great holiday, much of the regular business
being suspended and the people turned out in their best clothes to
celebrate what was to them the greatest day in the history of the city.

The train pulled into the city to the tune of hundreds of voices, that
contained but little harmony but plenty of volume. Arms, hats and
handkerchiefs were waved in accompaniment, displaying a due
appreciation for the beginning of what was to make Cedar Rapids the
beautiful and prosperous city that it is. A railroad was what was
needed and it was now theirs.

The terminal of the road was about where the packing house is now
located, and it was a couple of years before an extension was made, the
track being laid as far as the location of the cereal mills, which at
that time was an enterprise yet to come.

Mr. Haman says that one incident is fixed indelibly on his memory, and
that was the big dance that was held that night. He was obliged to
remain at the store during the day and did not get to see the train
come in, but he attended the dance which continued until sunrise the
next morning. He was a single man and as was the custom had his lady
friend with him and was obliged to send her home in an omnibus, the
then prevailing means of transportation about the city, as it was time
to open the store and he did not have time to accompany her home. The
dance was held in what was known as Daniels hall, located where the
Masonic Temple now stands.

Another who has recollections of the great event is Emery Brown and it
was in conversation between Mr. Haman and Emery Brown that these facts
were collected. The road was extended to Cedar Rapids from Clinton,
where connection was made to Chicago. There was no bridge across the
Mississippi river at that time and the trains were ferried across the
river by means of a large, flat ferry boat.

In order to secure the railroad the town was obliged to give $100,000
to the railroad company. Stock was issued in payment. James L. Bever
was another man in business here at that time and he made it a point to
purchase all this city stock he could, which proved to be to his
advantage. The road was later leased by the Northwestern and finally
purchased.

With reference to this road a Linn county biography offers the
following:

     "The organization under which this line came into Cedar
     Rapids was the Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railroad company,
     which was organized at Clinton in January, 1856. There were
     several railroad prospects about this time formulating in
     Clinton, or in places having a close proximity to the
     Mississippi. Finally all the railroad enterprises extending
     westward from the river united in the Chicago, Iowa and
     Nebraska railroad. When that company commenced their
     operations, it was expected it would have the co-operation
     of the Galena company. Failing to receive this it pressed
     forward its work unaided, and by the latter part of 1857 had
     the track laid as far as the Wapsipinicon river, a distance
     of thirty-six miles. In July, 1858, it was laid as far as
     Clarence, Cedar county, and in December, the same year, the
     road was completed to Lisbon, sixty-four miles from Clinton.
     The following June (1859) the locomotive steamed into Cedar
     Rapids, a distance of eighty-two miles from the Mississippi.
     There was great rejoicing here and the event was duly
     celebrated.

     "It was a most important event to Cedar Rapids for it was
     the termination of a struggle for railroad supremacy in the
     county.

     "In 1862 the road was leased to the Chicago and Northwestern
     company, and before the lease expired it had secured control
     of it. Work was resumed on the extension (for which the
     Cedar Rapids and Missouri Railroad company was organized),
     and pushed with vigor. It was completed across the great
     state of Iowa to Council Bluffs in 1867, where it made
     connections with the Union Pacific."

CHAPTER X

_Postoffices and Politics_


The following may be of some interest, especially as to the names of
the persons mentioned by S. W. Durham as proper persons with whom to
consult on matters bearing upon the political issues of the day. It
also shows how they fought for postoffices then as they do now, and how
careful and shrewd these old fellows were in getting in touch with
their constituents. According to a letter from the assistant
postmaster-general, Dr. Brice is not deserving of the office, and
George Melton is recommended. This was referred to S. W. Durham, as
well as the change of the name of the postoffice from Lindon to
Springville. It was signed by fifty-eight citizens of Springville. A.
C. Dodge was born in 1812, the son of Henry Dodge. He was in congress
until the territory became a state, and with G. W. Jones became one of
the first two senators from Iowa. Mr. Dodge remained in congress till
1855 when the democratic party lost control of the state and a union of
all the other parties elected James Harlan to succeed him. Senator
Dodge was later minister to Spain. He died in 1883, having won the
respect and confidence of all political parties. The letters show how
carefully the friends of Dodge kept him in touch with political
conditions in every township in his district.

The assembly met at Iowa City on December 4, 1848. G. W. Jones was a
candidate against Judge T. S. Wilson, who lost by a majority of one.
Dodge had no opposition in his own party and received the unanimous
nomination. The democratic party in this session had a majority on
joint ballot. He no doubt had been busy, and had his friends keep him
posted on the course of events. This list no doubt was furnished him
for the purpose of keeping in touch with the electors and to give him
an opportunity to select postmasters in accordance with services
rendered. The letters give some the name whig, which would go to show
that all the remainder could be relied upon as democratic in their
beliefs.

The list has names of a number of men who later became noted lawyers,
doctors, and shrewd business men.

The Marion postoffice was not always a plum to fight over, as it has
been of late. It was first established in 1839 at the home of L. M.
Strong, a farmer and tavern-keeper within the present confines of the
county seat. L. Daniels came in 1840 to start the first store, and he
in turn became the postmaster for a time till he gave it up to John
Zunro, who with Mr. Hoops started a grocery store and wanted the
postoffice so as to have people coming in now and then.

Post Office Department
Appointment Office, Aug. 9, 1854.

     Sir:

     S. M. Brice, the Postmaster at Center Point, County of Linn,
     State of Iowa, is said not to have deserved the appointment.
     The late P. M. recommends George Melton.

     Before submitting this case to the Postmaster General, I
     have to request the favor of any information you may
     possess, or be able conveniently to obtain, respecting it.

                  I have the honor to be,
                       Very respectfully, &c.

                                          HORATIO KING,

                              First Assistant Postmaster General.

     HON. A. C. DODGE,
         U. S. Senator.

     Endorsed:
         (Private)

     Dear Friend:

     Please enquire into the matter herein referred to & let me
     know the result & greatly oblige,

                       Truly your friend,
                                           A. C. DODGE.

     S. W. Durham, Esq.

Dr. S. M. Brice was located in Center Point about 1840-41, going there
from Cedar Rapids. He remained but a short time. Dr. Brice was a whig
in politics, and Center Point had always been strongly democratic. He
was the first postmaster of the village.

The objections set out in the letter must have been political for he
was considered a wide-awake and estimable man in every particular.

Post Office Department,
Appointment Office, July 22, 1854.

     Sir:

     A. P. Risley, the Postmaster at Springville, County of Linn,
     State of Iowa, with 58 citizens, recommends the change of
     site and name of the office to Lindon.

     Before submitting this case to the Postmaster General, I
     have to request the favor of any information you may
     possess, or be able conveniently to obtain, respecting it.

                  I have the honor to be,
                       Very respectfully, etc.,

                                          HORATIO KING,
                              First Assistant Postmaster General.

     HON. A. C. DODGE,
         U. S. Senator.
             Endorsed, The same of this, etc.,
                 greatly
                     oblige
                         Yours truly,
                             A. C. DODGE.

             S. W. Durham, Esq.

In 1842 the first postoffice was established in the township known as
Brown by Isaac Butler. It was the third postoffice in the county and
was known as Springville. Mail was received on horseback weekly. A. P.
Risley opened a store in 1845 and became postmaster. He is the person
referred to in the letter of Senator Dodge. Mr. Risley sold out and
removed a mile east of the town, and with A. E. Sampson laid out a new
town called Lindon. A postoffice was secured though not without a
fight, and the town of New Lindon assumed the airs of city life. A
hotel and blacksmith shop also kept the town alive for the time, but it
died like other towns when the railroad was secured by Springville, and
the booming town of Lindon has been for many years a good corn field
and a rich pasture. Sterling became postmaster at Springville after
Risley. He was succeeded by John Hoffman.


THE CEDAR RAPIDS POSTOFFICE

While Joseph Greene was postmaster he also acted as the first
storekeeper of the town, and it is related of him that he carried his
mail in his hat. The following, written by J. L. Enos, in the _Cedar
Valley Times_, may give the reader an idea of the postoffice situation
up to the close of the Civil war. He writes as follows:

     "The postoffice was established in 1847 and Joseph Greene
     appointed postmaster. Mr. Greene was removed on a change of
     administration, and L. Daniels appointed to succeed him.
     Homer Bishop was the third incumbent and held the office
     through a succession of years, giving very general
     satisfaction. At the commencement of Lincoln's
     administration Mr. Bishop was removed, and in accordance
     with a mistaken and dangerous policy which promotes men of a
     particular class or profession in places of trust, without
     regard to their moral or any other qualifications--J. G.
     Davenport, until then the editor of the _Cedar Valley
     Times_, was appointed.

     "Those acquainted with Davenport did not suppose he would be
     able to present satisfactory bonds but after some little
     delay he succeeded in procuring them and in due course of
     time took possession of the office. (Though a republican in
     politics, Mr. Davenport had to appeal to democratic friends
     for these bonds. J. J. Snouffer was one of them and shared
     in the subsequent loss.)

[Illustration: W. F. SEVERA Cedar Rapids]

     "A large number of clerks (?) was found necessary and it
     became evident that the office was managed with great
     recklessness. Money was lost through the mail when sent to
     the nearest postoffice on the route, and money sent to
     persons in the city from adjacent offices never came to
     hand. Postage stamps were borrowed from neighboring offices
     and return payment obtained with great difficulty, and in
     some cases there was a refusal to pay--because as he
     (Davenport) said, he had already paid the amount borrowed.
     He was at last removed, and on settling up the affairs of
     the office, there was found to be a shortage to the amount
     of fifteen hundred dollars. His bondsmen went to work and
     finally succeeded in effecting a credit on a part of the
     amount and had the satisfaction of paying about one thousand
     dollars, which had been stolen from the government by this
     arch swindler. After minor swindling operations he
     absconded, thus relieving the city of the most bare-faced
     falsifier and swindler that has infested the city since the
     time of Shepard & Co., in the early day.

     "George M. Howlett, the present incumbent, was appointed his
     successor and makes an efficient officer. In the spring of
     1865 Cedar Rapids was designated as a money order office,
     commencing operations as such on the 3d of July following.
     This enlarges the responsibility of the office and great
     care is necessary to keep all things right--though the
     blanks furnished make the work simple in honest hands."

       *       *       *       *       *

L. Daniels was another of the early postmasters. He, also, was a
merchant, and so was Homer Bishop, his successor in office. It was not
until J. G. Davenport became postmaster that the postoffice got into
politics. In fact it was no plum worth having till about the time of
the Civil war. A number of prominent men have since that time held the
postoffice--such as Captain W. W. Smith, Charles Weare, Alex. Charles,
Geo. A. Lincoln, W. R. Boyd, and W. G. Haskell, the present incumbent.

A. C. Taylor relates how, when he came to Cedar Rapids, he carried on
his jewelry store in the postoffice building, his store being located
on the alley, in the rear of where the Masonic Temple now stands. The
postoffice at Cedar Rapids soon outgrew the first government building,
erected in the '90s, and the second was completed in 1909 at a cost of
$250,000.

If a person asked for his mail in the olden days more than once a month
he was considered too important, and the postmaster would gently remind
him that he had no legal right to bother a man more than once a month,
at least, about such a small matter as a letter. The postoffice during
the past sixty-three years has grown to enormous proportions, till it
now takes the entire time of a score of people to expedite the handling
of the mails.




CHAPTER XI

_The Physicians of the County_

BY FREDERICK G. MURRAY


Among the first doctors who located in and around Marion should be
mentioned S. H. Tryon, F. W. Tailor, and James Cummings. These men came
before 1840. They were followed by T. S. Bardwell and L. W. Phelps. Dr.
Tryon at least came as early as 1838 and was for many years a
well-known public character. He acted as county clerk and held many
posts of honor.

Dr. J. K. Rickey bought John Young's claim in Cedar Rapids as early as
1841 and must have been located in that vicinity at that time. What
became of him is not known, and whether or not he engaged in the
practice extensively is doubtful. There were not many whites there in
those early days and it is a question if any had the time or
inclination to be very sick. In case they were it was no doubt
homesickness, for which a doctor has so far been unable to offer any
permanent cure.

The first doctor who came to Cedar Rapids was inclined to blow his own
horn. J. L. Enos, the editor of the _Cedar Valley Times_, has the
following to say: "Once when he had returned from Muscatine he claimed
to have lost forty pounds of quinine in one of the streams below the
Cedar. Constable Lewis once called on him with an execution to secure a
judgment. The doctor threw off his coat and prepared for a fight. The
constable seeing his opportunity seized the coat and made away with it
and found therein sufficient money to satisfy the debt."

Profiting by the example, later comers have avoided fights and have
tried to pay their debts.

In the correspondence between S. W. Durham and A. C. Dodge in December,
1848, the following named doctors are referred to: S. M. Brice (whig),
Center Point; Ivanhoe, Jno. Evans; Hollenback P. O., Dr. Williams;
Cedar Rapids P. O., J. F. Ely.

Thus during 1848 the above named persons must have been residents and
practicing physicians in their respective localities. Dr. Brice was the
second doctor in Cedar Rapids. Later he moved to Center Point. These
men were no doubt slated as candidates for postmasters. Dr. Brice later
acted as postmaster at Center Point.

A history of the medical profession in Linn county must be largely made
up of a list of names, as the intrinsic work of the medical
practitioner is scarcely a fit subject matter for the casual reader.

What seems to be the earliest date in connection with which there is
mention of a physician in the county annals is 1841, in which year Dr.
Magnus Holmes came to the town of Marion from Crawfordsville, Indiana.
Promising to be of great value to the community, Dr. Holmes passed away
a short time after his arrival. Dr. Henry M. Ristine, father of Dr. J.
M. Ristine, of Cedar Rapids, was a brother-in-law of Dr. Holmes, and
came to Marion from Indiana in 1842. Another of the very earliest
practitioners was Dr. Sam Grafton, who was located on the Cedar river
at Ivanhoe bridge, on the old military road from Dubuque to Iowa City.
Just when he came is not known; this was one of the earliest
settlements in the county and he had practiced there for some four
years previous to 1847, in which year he fell a victim to a typhoid
epidemic. Dr. Amos Witter was one of the first physicians in Mt.
Vernon. He passed away in 1862 at the age of fifty-five, having been
several years a member of the legislature. In 1886 there was still
living in Viola a Dr. S. S. Matson, who had practiced there since 1845.
He graduated from the University of Vermont in 1832, the same year in
which Dr. Elisha W. Lake, an early Marion physician, graduated from the
Ohio Medical College. These two men are in point of graduation the
oldest men the county has had. In northeastern Linn the first physician
was Dr. Stacy, who lived on the Anamosa and Quasqueton road near
Boulder church. He was a brother to the late Judge Stacy, the pioneer
promoter of the Dubuque & Southwestern Railroad. Some of the other
early practitioners were Dr. E. L. Mansfield, who came to Cedar Rapids
or Kingston in 1847; Dr. J. M. Traer, who made Cedar Rapids his home
from 1847-51; Dr. J. F. Ely, who came to the same place in 1848; and
Dr. S. D. Carpenter, who came in 1849.

Dr. Shattuck, of Green's Mills, now Coggon, Drs. Lannin and Byam, of
Paris, Drs. Patterson and Mitchell, of Clark's Ford, now Central City,
and Dr. Young, of Prairieburg, were all pioneer doctors in their
respective communities. Dr. T. S. Bardwell, who became a leading
physician of Marion, settled on a farm in that vicinity in 1840, making
his residence in the county date back farther than that of any other
medical man except S. H. Tryon.

A rather incomplete business directory of Cedar Rapids in 1856 gives
the following as physicians: S. C. Koontz, J. H. Camburn, W. D.
Barclay, J. W. Edes, Smith & Larrabee, R. R. Taylor.

A complete city directory published in 1869 gives the names of the
following: C. F. Bullen, J. H. Camburn, G. P. Carpenter, J. P. Coulter,
J. W. Edes, Mansfield & Smith, Freeman McClelland, John North, Israel
Snyder, C. H. Thompson, W. Bollinger, J. C. May. Of these, Dr. Camburn
and Dr. Edes were prominent in their profession for many years. Dr. R.
R. Taylor was a Virginian, who went to reside in Philadelphia about the
time of the Civil war. Dr. J. C. May was a druggist as well as a very
popular physician. He was a brother of the late Major May, of island
fame.

A medical and surgical directory of Iowa for 1876 gives the first
authentic list of doctors in Linn county to which access has been had.
A list of fifty is given as in active practice in the county at that
time. Only six of these remain: Dr. George P. Carpenter, dean of the
profession in Cedar Rapids; Dr. G. R. Skinner, of Cedar Rapids; Dr. T.
S. Kepler, of Mt. Vernon; Dr. Hindman, of Marion; Dr. Edwin Burd, of
Lisbon; and Dr. F. M. Yost, of Center Point. The last of these, Dr.
Yost, class of 1853 University of Pennsylvania, is the oldest living
practitioner in the county. His two sons are now associated with him in
his work. One other, Dr. J. H. Smith, of Cedar Rapids, has not been in
practice for many years but preserves a close relation to his old
calling through his presidency of the board of directors of St. Luke's
Hospital. The two Doctors Sigworth are still living near their old
neighborhood, having retired to Anamosa.

A registry of all physicians practicing in the county was begun in the
county clerk's office in 1880-1881. It started with sixty-four names,
probably the full number of those in active practice at the time. Since
then about 230 additional doctors have been registered, and of this
total of nearly 300 about 125 are now practicing in the county.

At Western some of the early physicians were Dr. Crouse, Dr. W. B.
Wagner, Dr. Miller, all of whom preceded Dr. J. C. Schrader who removed
to Iowa City. Dr. J. C. Hanshay located here in 1863 and Dr. Favour in
1877. Dr. Patterson was the first doctor in Bertram, in 1857. Dr. J.
Stricklippe was an early doctor and druggist at Palo, and Dr. J. W.
Firkin was the second doctor at Vanderbilt, later known as Fairfax. His
son, Edgar Firkin, is now a popular druggist there. Dr. U. C. Roe came
to Fairfax in 1864 for the practice of medicine. He also sold drugs.
The business finally drifted into a grocery store, as it seems that the
settlers preferred sugar and prunes to pills and quinine.

Among names of note in the early history of these parts are those of
several medical doctors whose prominence came along lines outside of
their professional work. Dr. John P. Ely's name is prominently
connected with the early business enterprises and later growth of Cedar
Rapids. The doctor was called in the year he finished his medical
studies in New York to the management of commercial and manufacturing
interests in this county. The growth of these drew him gradually from
the excellent practice for which he at first found time. To the close
of his life, however, Dr. Ely kept himself well informed on the
progress of scientific medicine. Perhaps the first autopsy in this
locality was performed by Dr. Ely in the interests of both science and
sobriety, if early annals are authentic, the subject having been in
life notorious for his potations.

Dr. Eber L. Mansfield along with a large medical practice found time to
build up successful business and real estate interests on both sides of
the river at Cedar Rapids.

Dr. Seymour D. Carpenter left the practice after the Civil war and
became active and highly successful in the building and financing of
railroads in this state and further south. Dr. Carpenter is still
living in a hale old age in Chicago.

Dr. Freeman McClelland, a talented graduate of Jefferson Medical
College, won for himself enviable popularity and influence through his
editorship of the Cedar Rapids _Times_. The flavor of his writings and
rare personality are an enduring remembrance with all who knew him.

Dr. J. T. Headley, the eminent platform lecturer, at present living
retired in Philadelphia, is said to have first hung out his "shingle"
in Cedar Rapids.

Dr. G. W. Holmes, son of Dr. Magnus Holmes, of Marion, after finishing
at Bellevue, went as a medical missionary of the American Board to
Persia, where in addition to his other work he became royal physician
to the Crown Prince, afterwards Shah of Persia. Dr. Holmes passed away
in June, 1910.

Linn county sent a number of doctors to the army during the Civil war.
The following list is as nearly accurate as to men and organizations as
it was possible to make it:

Dr. H. M. Ristine, surgeon 20th Iowa Infantry.

Dr. J. F. Ely, surgeon 24th Iowa.

Dr. J. H. Camburn, surgeon 16th Iowa Infantry, also 6th Iowa Cavalry.

Dr. Freeman McClelland, surgeon 16th Iowa Infantry.

Dr. H. M. Lyons, surgeon 16th Iowa Infantry.

Dr. John F. Smith, assistant surgeon 65th Illinois Infantry.

Dr. G. L. Carhardt, surgeon 31st Iowa.

Dr. J. C. Shrader went from near Western College, this county, with the
22d Iowa Infantry as captain and later as surgeon.

Dr. Amos Witter, surgeon 7th Iowa Infantry.

Dr. T. S. Bardwell served as first assistant surgeon with the 6th Iowa
Cavalry, Col. Carskadden of Marion, notably in an expedition against
the Indians who were threatening the Nebraska and Dakota frontier, the
male portion of the settlers there being largely absent in the Union
army.

Dr. Seth Byam, of Jackson township, was surgeon in the U. S. army.

Dr. Seymour D. Carpenter, surgeon U. S. A., during the four years of
the war.

Of those who served otherwise than as surgeons, Dr. J. P. Coulter was
lieutenant colonel of the 12th Iowa Infantry. He afterwards was active
in city and county politics and held several official positions, and
distantly related to him was the late Dr. A. B. Coulter, in whose
untimely passing away the community lost one of its most promising
professional men.

Dr. G. R. Skinner, who came to Cedar Rapids in 1871, spent four years
in the Civil war, leaving the service with a captain's commission.

[Illustration: THE LATE DR. J. S. LOVE, SPRINGVILLE]

Dr. W. H. French served through the war in the 89th Illinois Infantry.

Of those men whose distinctly professional work brought them especial
esteem, space will allow for the mention of only a few.

Perhaps for no other one of their brethren did the Linn county
profession award so universal preference as to Dr. Henry Ristine.
Pioneer, patriot, and public-spirited citizen, he was first and before
all a doctor, combining in generous measure the traits and faculties
that make an eminently successful surgeon, with culture and genial
sympathies. It could be truly said of him that he adorned his
profession. His portrait hangs in St. Luke's Hospital along with that
of the late Judge Greene, whom he ably seconded in the work of founding
that institution. Jurist and surgeon alike believed in the hospital as
the workshop without which the doctor could not do his best work, and
their efforts accomplished much toward the establishment of medical and
surgical justice to the physically afflicted, a form of service that
deserves more and more public recognition in every community where
moral justice to the criminally accused is so amply facilitated by the
courts of law.

Among other well remembered physicians were Dr. J. S. Love, of
Springville, Dr. James Carson, of Mt. Vernon, Dr. D. McClenahan, of
Cedar Rapids, and Dr. G. L. Carhardt, of Marion. Beginning at an early
date and devoting themselves exclusively to their practice till
advancing age forced retirement, they all four typically exemplified in
their respective communities the life of the family physician. They
were, none of them, modern doctors, but they lived not only to see but
to rejoice in the day of modern medicine. Long after they had ceased
from practice they kept up attendance at medical society meetings,
keenly alive to the advancements of medical art and scientific research
there discussed. They were resourceful men, and they had labored
faithfully and well with the art available in their day, how often
futilely none felt more keenly than themselves. The realization that
modern methods promised control of much that had baffled them seemed to
lighten the burden of their declining years. Their abiding interest and
faith in the future things of medicine was an inspiration to their
successors.

Of medical organizations in Linn county the oldest is the Union Medical
Society, founded as the Linn County Medical Society at Mt. Vernon in
1859 by Drs. Love, Ely, Ristine, Carson, and Lyon. Dormant during the
war, it resumed in 1866 and ran till 1873, when its name was changed to
the Iowa Union and it became a district society, taking its membership
from half a dozen or more counties and centering in Linn and Johnson
counties. It still meets twice a year at Cedar Rapids, occasionally at
Iowa City for scientific work. Its officers now are: president, C. W.
Baker, Stanwood; secretary, F. G. Murray, Cedar Rapids; treasurer, C.
P. Carpenter, Cedar Rapids.

The present Linn County Society was organized in Cedar Rapids in 1903.
It holds meetings twice a year and is the unit of the State and
American Medical Associations. One of its members, Dr. G. E. Crawford,
is the outgoing president of the Iowa State Medical Society. Its
present officers are: president, Dr. A. B. Poore; secretary, Dr. H. W.
Bender; treasurer, Frank S. Skinner.

There are other local organizations at Mt. Vernon and Cedar Rapids. The
Practitioners' Club of the latter place meets once a month for
discussion and action upon medical subjects of special interest to the
members. Its officers are: Dr. H. S. Raymer, president; H. E. Pfeiffer,
secretary; G. P. Carpenter, treasurer.

St. Luke's Hospital at Cedar Rapids has already been mentioned. It was
founded in 1883. On its consulting staff are Drs. G. P. Carpenter, J.
M. Ristine, G. R. Skinner, G. E. Crawford, A. B. Poore, and A. H.
Johnson. It has an attending staff of younger men. The hospital has
seventy-five beds, having recently added a new and completely appointed
maternity department. Mercy Hospital, ninety beds, founded at Cedar
Rapids in 1902 and housed in its spacious new building in 1904, is
under the care of the Sisters of Mercy. These finely equipped
institutions serve Cedar Rapids, Marion, the railroad systems and their
contributing territory with facilities for the best of medical,
surgical and maternity work. Few realize the large amount of free
humanitarian work they accomplish every year. Together with Linn
county's own excellent infirmary north of Marion they represent in a
material and public way the present status of medical art, science, and
humanitarianism in the county. Personally and privately these are
represented by the 125 active practitioners of medicine.

It will be noted that the names of only a few of these have been
mentioned and then only incidentally. The scope of this sketch does not
allow adequate individual reference to the remainder. Nor is this the
place to record contemporary progress. The lives of all the present
members of the profession belong not to the past but to the future
history of medicine in Linn county. The attached list gives the names

CHAPTER XII

_The Material Growth of the County_


In scarcely any locality has the material growth been so fast and
substantial during the past seventy years as in Linn county. Old
residents who have returned after a period of twenty-five to thirty
years mention this fact, and what is true of the cities and towns is
perhaps much more true of the rural districts in general.

William Abbe erected a bark cabin for the use of his family the first
summer, after he came here, and built a log house that fall for his
winter abode. Ed Crow, C. C. Haskins, and others also erected very
frail cabins during the first year they lived within the confines of
the county. John Henry, it is said, built a small store-building facing
the river in the squatter town of Westport in 1838. It was a frame
building about 14 x 18, scarcely high enough for any of the Oxley
Brothers (who were very tall men) to enter. He also erected a small
dwelling house near the store-building, which, if anything, was smaller
than the store-building. All the lumber in these buildings, except the
window frames and the sills, were cut in the timber adjoining the
river; even the roof was cut out of rough boards, with a broad saw. The
nails used were brought from Muscatine, as well as a few hinges, and
the windows. These buildings were torn down in 1860. The Shepherd
Tavern was also a rude log building, as was the John Young house, which
was afterwards used as a hotel, with additions added later.

G. R. Carroll, in his _Pioneer Life_, mentions the first cabin erected
by his father, Isaac Carroll, in 1839. It took about ten days to erect
an ordinary cabin. "It stood on the east side of the road near Mr.
Bower's nursery on the boulevard one and a half miles from the river.
It was a very primitive looking structure, 16 x 18 perhaps, with what
we called a cob roof, made of clapboards with logs on top to hold them
in place. It was quite an agreeable change from our tent and wagons
when we entered this new cabin, although there was not a great deal of
room to spare after our goods were unloaded and the nine members of the
family were gathered within its walls. When the table was spread there
was no passing from one side to the other, except as we got upon our
hands and knees and crawled under."

Mr. Carroll also speaks of the second house, which was erected the same
fall on the same premises. "It was, however, not to be a common kind of
a cabin, it was to be a somewhat ambitious structure for the time, in
fact it was to be the best house in Linn county, and when completed, it
enjoyed that distinction. It was said, that there was nothing in the
county that equalled it. The dimensions of this house were 14 x 16, a
story and a half high. There were in the walls of this house between
fifty and sixty white oak logs, most of them quite straight and free
from knots. The ends of the logs were cut off square and the corners
were laid up like square blocks, care being taken to cut off enough at
the ends to allow the logs to come as close together as possible so as
to leave but little space for chinking and plastering when it came to
the finishing up. The only boards about the entire building were in the
door which I think were brought with us on top of our wagon-box, which
was of extra height. The joists above and below were made of logs, the
upper ones squared with a broadax. The casings of doors and windows,
and the floors above and below, were made out of bass wood puncheons.
Slabs were spread out of the logs and then hewn out with a broad axe
and the edges were made straight by the use of the chalk line. The
gable ends were sided up with clapboard rived out of oak timber three
or four feet long, and then shaved off smooth like siding. The rafters
were made of hickory poles trimmed off straight on the upper side, and
strips three or four inches wide were nailed on the sheeting. Upon
these strips shingles made of oak eighteen inches long and nicely
shaven, were laid. The logs of the walls in the inside were hewn off
flat, and the interstices between were shingled and plastered with lime
mortar, the lime being burned by my father on Indian Creek. There were
three windows below of twelve lights each, with glass 7 x 9, and a
window in each of the gable ends of nine lights, which furnished light
for the room above. The fire place was built up of logs on the outside
and lined with stone within, and the chimney was built of sticks split
out about the size of laths and plastered with clay, both inside and
outside."

The description of this house gives the reader an idea of one of the
most up-to-date houses built before the year 1840. During the past
sixty years many commodious farm houses have been erected, having all
the modern conveniences installed, such as heating, lighting, together
with bath privileges connected with sanitary plumbing. It is said that
the late S. C. Bever installed the first furnace in a dwelling house in
Linn county, and many people came from over the county to see such a
furnace work. Now, not only cities and towns, but farm residences have
installed furnaces and other kinds of heating plants, so that which was
a novelty fifty years ago is very ordinary today.

The farmers in Linn county early began to invest their surplus money in
farm machinery. William Ure drove an ox team to Chicago and brought
back a McCormick reaper, which was the first reaper brought into the
county, as far as is known. At least it was the first reaper used and
operated in and around Scotch Grove. The neighbors said that Ure was
foolish and it would surely break him up, but inside of one season it
paid for itself. In and around Stoney Point one of the first threshing
machines was used; a very small machine which was staked fast on the
ground, without a straw-carrier, and operated by horsepower, which was
placed on the ground loose and had to be hauled from place to place on
a truck. In Linn Grove, Brown township, Washington township, and in
other localities, many of these crude reapers and crude threshing
machines and corn shellers were seen in operation during the season.
Frequently the people who purchased these early machines lost money.
The machinery was not always recommended, and sometimes the farmers
were not mechanics skilled enough to make repairs when needed. A number
got fooled on the first wire-binders and on the check-rowers, as well
as on some of the early mowing machines, and many lost heavily in early
days on thoroughbred horses and full-blooded cattle. But after all, the
spirit of progress was abroad in the community, and in spite of
failures, it did a great thing for the people who became interested.
The advent of the reaper no doubt changed farming methods in this
country. It is said that "the struggle for bread ceased when the reaper
was put on the market." At least it placed the struggle for existence
on a higher level. Certainly when a machine was invented that could do
the work of five or six men and be depended upon, such a machine was
worth having, and it soon paid for itself.

The manufacturing of farm machinery in Linn county was not a financial
success, as is shown by the failure of the Williams Harvester Works,
the Ogden Plow Works, the Star Wagon Works, and many other enterprises,
but the spirit displayed by those who were willing to put their money
into these untried enterprises, showed the mettle and the ingenuity
that many of these early settlers had. People profited by these
failures, made a study of the subject, and in course of time these men
who lost at times on some investment or purchased machinery which was
not suitable to the country, became owners of magnificent farms and
up-to-date farmers by long experience.

The early corn cribs and granaries were generally built of rails, the
kinks filled in with straw or hay. They of course had to be rebuilt
every fall, and more or less grain was wasted. The rail corn crib was
superseded by long board cribs generally built on the ground without
any foundation. These cribs, when empty, were generally blown about the
premises and had to be hauled back and propped up before they could be
used in the fall. The farmers of Linn county frequently visited in
Illinois, and there found models for economical corn cribs. They also
read the farm journals, and it was not long until our farmers erected
the modern corn crib and granary with gasoline engines, dumps, and
elevators. These cribs were substantially built on cement foundations
with cement floors, and with a driveway large enough and wide enough to
house several wagons and three or four buggies at one time. The early
corn crib, it is true, cost little or nothing, but they were a source
of expense and annoyance, and much grain was wasted. The modern corn
crib, as now erected, is built for a life time, but at a cost of from
two thousand to three thousand dollars, which would have been a sum
impossible to raise by the early settler, who generally paid the
government price on his land by disposing of skins which he prepared
during the winter, and who went barefooted in summer for the reason
that he had no money to buy shoes and no time to make moccasins for
himself or his children.

Thus the early farmer housed his horses and cattle in straw stacks
during the winter and in the timber during the summer. Sometime a hay
thatched stable was erected for the use of the horses. He milked his
cows out on the snow in winter, and expected them to yield a fair
supply of milk on a diet of slough hay and dry corn stalks, and would
drive them to water to some creek or river once a day, using an ax with
which to cut a hole in the ice. These stables would leak in spring and
summer and had to be rebuilt nearly every fall. All hay was stacked
outside and nearly half of it would rot during the rainy season. But
hay was cheaper than lumber and for that reason a man had to figure on
putting up enough hay during the summer, and take into account the
waste. It was not till after the Civil war that many barns were built,
and then only the rich farmer could afford them. Not till the '70s and
'80s did the craze for barn building come, and now nearly every farm of
any size, and nearly every farmer of any financial standing, has a good
substantial barn, as well as machine sheds, all of which improvements
may cost from three thousand to ten thousand dollars.

In the early days many farmers were fooled or taken in on the creamery
proposition, as many of these small country creameries failed. The
people then began to study the cow and the cost of producing milk and
butter. True the first attempts were not a success, but the butter and
milk of Linn county have during the past twenty-five years made many of
the farmers wealthy. It used to be, that if the cows could keep down
the grocery bill that was well done, but now, many a farmer gets a
monthly milk check of from fifty to seventy-five dollars, which not
only pays the grocery bill, but generally the hired man as well. But
then the price of butter has increased from six cents to thirty, which
makes a difference. The butter has also gradually become a better
quality, and is really worth more. It is taken care of now, while in
the pioneer days the cream was left out doors during the hot summer and
the rancid butter was placed in a shallow slough well so as to be kept
cool. It was generally not fit to use and was traded at the store for
dried prunes, brown sugar, and dried herring. Thus, while the farmer
may not have given the merchant much, the merchant certainly did not
give the farmer anything of much value in return for his farm produce.

During the past twenty years no class of people have fared better
financially than the farmers, and no class of people have become more
enlightened on the subject in which they are engaged than the farmers.
This may be due to several reasons. The farm journals have no doubt
done much in stirring up a local pride in the vocation of farming. The
farm journal has taught the farmer not to be ashamed of his calling;
that while he may be called a "Rube" in some localities, he is an
intelligent, up-to-date, wide-awake man, who knows what is going on in
the country; is familiar with political questions and interested in the
welfare of the country and of the state in which he resides. During the
past twenty years the farmer, especially in Linn county, has traveled
much. He has attended the county and state fairs where he has seen the
latest inventions in machinery. He has attended nearly all of the
exhibitions held in the country from Chicago to Seattle, and has come
in contact with farmers from other sections of the country as well as
with financiers and men of affairs. He has traveled much on land
excursions and has learned to study and understand the nature of the
soil. While it is true, that these various journeys have taken some
time and money, yet they have made the farmer an up-to-date man,
familiar with all sides of human life, and he has discovered, after
all, that he is one of the most fortunate men in the country, and
financially better off than many a city brother who may wear broadcloth
and a boiled shirt, but whose bank account is generally depleted. The
Linn county farmer has learned during the past twenty-five years to
know himself and to understand and respect the class to which he
belongs. No one can become a successful person in any line of business
unless he is proud of the line of work in which he is engaged. The
farmer has learned this secret, and he is not ashamed to tell anyone,
that he is a Hawkeye farmer, owning his own farm and caring for his own
property. The Iowa farmer has kept up with the procession, and he
certainly is as intelligent, as wide-awake, and as shrewd and keen as
the merchant, the banker, and the professional man in his business
dealings. But he came to Iowa at the proper time, and for that reason
he had the advantage of the old settlers who came to New England or to
Jamestown. These men came ahead of their time and before things were
ripe for such settlement. The bread tools of the Virginia pioneer were
the same as those of the Indians whom they despised and wanted to drive
out. The first settlers of Iowa came with the advent of the reaper,
when a boy fifteen years of age could cut the grain with ease, which
several sturdy men had to do before with the sickle and the scythe.

We seem to think that we have had the modern inventions for ages, but
the first white settlers in Linn county, whoever they may have been,
knew nothing of matches; of stoves as we know them; of the telegraph or
the telephone or electric lights. They did not have modern corn
cultivators or stirring plows. All these so-called modern appliances
have been invented since the advent of the first settler in this
county. But it was not long after these inventions came into use, until
some enterprising individual or firm introduced them into Linn county.
It is said that it was at a Shriner meeting on the old State Fair
Ground, which is now Central Park, Cedar Rapids, that electricity was
first used in this county, and people came for many miles to watch this
peculiar light, which some thought could only be accounted for on the
ground that the operator was in close connection with the Evil One.
Barnum, with his show, also exhibited electric lights to the
consternation of the vast crowds that came to see his circus, and it
was one of the chief attractions during the first year. People came
many miles to listen and talk through a telephone, and now every
up-to-date farmer has an instrument installed in his own house.

In a material way the settlers in Linn county have succeeded beyond the
expectation of the most sanguine. Thrift and prosperity can be seen on
every hand. The various farmers' alliances, elevator companies, banking
companies, creamery companies, old settlers' unions, and all these have
brought the men over the county in closer touch with each other and the
farmers of the whole county have learned to appreciate the marvelous
benefits derived from social intercourse. It has made them broader and
more liberal minded toward one another.

The first real census of the county was made in 1840 by H. W. Gray, who
found 1,373 men, women, and children here. There were no less than 200
people who celebrated the 4th of July at Westport in 1838, but these
may not all have belonged to the county. There was a rapid influx of
people, and by 1845 it has been estimated that no less than 4,000 had
declared Linn county their permanent home. The men who came here in the
early days knew nothing of luxuries, for it is said that there were not
over twenty buggies in the county and not to exceed two pianos. The
gold excitement took many of the bright young men away, most of whom
never returned. The census of 1850 shows that there were 5,444 people
in the county, further demonstrating that the land seekers were still
coming despite the fact that many residents must have left for the gold
fields of California. By 1860 fully 19,000 residents claimed the county
as their home. At the first election in the county 39 votes were cast.
In 1875 there were more than 7,000 voters, and this number has
gradually increased till the votes cast in 1908 were 6,558 republican,
5,008 democratic, 220 prohibition, and 121 scattering, making a total
vote of 11,900. Long ago the farming districts were filled up and the
country portions have not grown in population. The demand for pioneers
has ceased, and the growth henceforth will be in the cities and towns,
and not in the country until such a time as the cities will be
compelled to expand or the people congregating therein will be enabled
to seek the country to make a living. There may also come a time when
the large farms will be divided up among members of the family and when
it will pay better to farm on a small rather than on a large scale. If
the land can be subdivided into small tracts, as in many parts of
Europe, Iowa and Linn county will be able to feed a much larger
population and at greater ease than can the exhausted lands of the old
countries.

The soil in Iowa is as rich today and will if well cared for produce
more today than it did some forty years ago. The farmers will now
devote more of their time to make the farms yield more and not in the
purchase of more lands as heretofore. What the modern farmer is now up
against is better markets, cheaper freight charges, more local
manufacturing, and increased commercial conveniences.

For many years after the lands were taken up and cultivated the farmers
were unable to get rid of their products. There were no other markets
than the local ones. Robert Ellis had tried the experiment of running
flat boats down the river and had returned without any profits. Holmes,
the Higley Brothers, Daniels, and others built flat boats at Ivanhoe
and shipped wheat in the early spring down the Cedar and made a little
money. But there was more or less risk, and much labor was expended,
and the returns were not always satisfactory. Many teamed and hauled
dressed pork, wheat, and barley to the Mississippi river, mostly to
Muscatine, but after the driver returned and figured up his expenses
and the cost of a few groceries and a calico dress for the wife, he had
little left with which to pay interest and tax on the land.

The farmer was kept busy in paying taxes and breaking up and fencing
more land. To do these things and keep his family was all he could hope
to accomplish. The business man who had come here was without funds,
and interest rates were high. He could not borrow enough to carry out
his scheme of factory building, as he had expected. Saw mills and grist
mills were erected so as to supply the local trade with enough
materials for building, and enough food to live on, but that was all.
The cost of transportation was high, and the cost of anything like
luxuries was so great that it was out of the question to purchase any.
As late as 1855 there were no markets and no means to ship anything out
except by flat boats early in the spring of the year when the water was
high. N. B. Brown started the first woolen mill as early as 1848. This
was later disposed of to the Bryan family, but the mill never was a
real success. There was no demand for the goods and the expense was too
high to ship the raw products in and the finished products out. To haul
any amount in a farm wagon a hundred miles over poor roads, subject to
all kinds of weather, is not a success to the hauler nor to the man who
hires him.

Even after the railroad was brought to Cedar Rapids the people did not
realize that there was any other but a local market for any product.
During the early years of the war, from 1862-3, the people awoke to a
realization that it would pay to get in touch with a larger market, and
the Chicago prices on stuff began to be quoted. R. D. Stephens built an
elevator at Marion and began sending corn to the river. Cattle and hogs
began to go up in price, and soon the people realized that the railroad
was not built to carry passengers only, but freight as well, and that
on a large scale.

In 1866 the number of acres assessed was 452,486, and the land,
exclusive of towns and villages, amounted to $3,012,754. The assessment
for Linn county in 1878 was 449,774 acres, $5,127,133. The actual
valuation in 1855 was about three and one-half millions, while in 1900
the taxable valuation of the county was something over twelve millions.

Butter and cheese making were at one time businesses which made the
farmers much money, but not till they learned how to prepare good
butter and get a market established for it. Soon agents came to Iowa
looking over the crops, and presently few towns were without local
agents who handled stock and grain on a commission basis.

Henceforth it was the Chicago market and not the local market that
governed, and the railroads were loaded down many seasons of the year
in hauling train load after train load of corn and wheat and cattle and
hogs, the property of the Iowa farmers. Iowa became in a short time the
food producing state in the Mississippi Valley and has so remained till
this day.

It was the productiveness of the soil, the manner in which the soil was
prepared and the prices for farm products that made the land valuable.
And it was the outside market that made farm produce worth the price it
was for a local market cannot do this. The Chicago market has become
the world market on many commodities, and lucky is the person who owns
lands within a safe radius of such a market.




CHAPTER XIII

_Rural Life_


The rural life of the pioneers in Linn county was much the same as it
was in any of the adjoining counties in eastern Iowa. The settlers were
intelligent, young, active, and enthusiastic, believing in the future
of the new State. The men were able to do nearly all kinds of
mechanical work without any help or assistance, while the women were
equally dextrous in spinning, weaving, and doing all kinds of house
work. They were all clad in homespun and no false standards were
maintained by the so-called well-to-do.

Wheat was the product for many years until the pest took it, and Indian
corn was grown. It was soon found that wheat was expensive to raise, as
seed was high, the cost of harvesting expensive, and frequently a
shower or a storm when the wheat was ripe destroyed a great deal of it,
so the farmer's summer work at times would be entirely gone. It cost
less to raise corn, and in course of time a market was found for it,
although it scarcely ever sold for more than 30 cents a bushel.

"In ye olden times" master and servant had no trouble. They ate at the
same table, worked side by side during the day, and it was a sort of
partnership affair throughout the season from the early spring until
the crops were gathered in the fall. During the entire season the hired
man had handled scarcely a dollar and he had taken up at the village
store on credit in the master's name goods that would not exceed in
value ten or fifteen dollars. While it has been often stated that in
the pioneer days the men were overworked and underpaid, which might be
true in part, still during these formative years, when everything was
new, and there were no classes, all settlers were on the same
level--socially and financially. It was not long until the hired man
had worked long enough to get sufficient money to make a first payment
on a farm, and in a few years the renter became a land owner and well
fixed.

The scattered settlers during the early years of their residence in
Linn county relied on their own ingenuity for everything they needed;
thus, they were their own blacksmiths, cabinet makers, carpenters,
tanners, stone masons, and shoe makers. They would tan their own
leather, shoe their own horses and oxen, make their own crude harness,
and get along and be satisfied. While they would depend on the village
blacksmith and on the wagon maker, roads were impassable in the spring
of the year and a yoke of oxen was not the swiftest means of getting to
and from a town twenty-five or thirty miles away. Hence a farmer who
had any ingenuity at all, would rather do his own work in a crude way,
than have to go to town to get anything repaired which was broken.

Much amusement was also had in the early days in the various
communities where men and women enjoyed meeting together at social
functions. There were quilting bees, spelling schools, barn raisings,
log rolling, debating schools, singing schools, and many other
gatherings which frequently ended with a barn dance or a house warming
supper, provided by the host and hostess.

The winter season in "ye olden times" was not an easy time of it by any
means, for the pioneers went to the timber early in the morning and
would stay all day and until late at night, cutting wood, making rails
and getting big logs to the saw mills. It mattered not what was the
kind of weather, the young man would start off to the timber with the
thermometer frequently at from twenty-five to thirty below zero.
Sometimes it would be pleasant in the morning when they started out,
but frequently a severe blizzard would come up before night, and many
were the frozen hands and ears they would bring home to thaw out late
at night, having been out all day in the most severe weather. But as
soon as it was over it was forgotten, and the next day or the next week
the young man would again repeat the same performance.

While the men were strong, active, and hardworking, the women were
equally active, persevering and industrious. The girls always took care
of the milk and butter; the straining of the milk was done by the
slough well or in a dark mud cellar, with no stone in it, and which
always kept caving in until the entire house had to be put on pillars.
The wife frequently had the family washing out by sunrise and the hired
girl, if the family could afford one, would work side by side with her
mistress and would do both inside and outside work if needed. No one
was afraid to work: in fact they were all proud of what they had
accomplished.

There were not many varieties of dishes on the table in pioneer days,
and still the settlers had plenty of good, wholesome food, and were
always hungry. Salt pork, johnny cake, honey, and game were the
customary foods of the farmer in ye olden times. They scarcely ever
tasted fresh meat from spring until fall, unless some of the boys shot
a little game now and then. The settlers were companionable, good
natured, and contented. They traded cattle, horses, mules, and at times
farms, only now and then would trouble arise as one would accuse
another of smart dealings, and a lawsuit would ensue. It is related of
an itinerant preacher who purchased a yoke of oxen from one of the
deacons in the church, that while he was testing the oxen on a hot
Sunday driving to church with his family, the yoke squatted down in a
mud hole and remained there and it was impossible to move them at all.
The preacher spied the deacon coming to church and was not slow in
telling him what he thought of him as well as the oxen he had sold him.
The deacon was not at all worried but replied, "parson, you must not
forget to swear at 'em, that is the only thing they know," and drove on
as though not at all offended by the remarks of the preacher.

In the early days the farmers had no cisterns, no wind mills, no deep
wells. Rain water was gathered in barrels which dried up in summer and
froze solid in winter, so the house wife had scarcely any rain water
either summer or winter. The well was generally a ten foot shallow well
dug down by the slough, poorly planked, and frequently it caved in;
another well was dug much in the same manner as the old one, the new
well soon meeting with the same ending as the former one.

There were few, if any, barns in the olden times and straw thatched
sheds and stables were universally used. These stables were moved
frequently for the reason that the farmers failed to haul out the
manure which accumulated, finding that it was easier and cheaper to
move the stable than to haul away the manure. Nearly all of the hay was
stacked out doors and had to be cut and hauled away in order to be fed
to the cattle.

The farmers were slow and backward in many things. They possessed no
spirit of restlessness and took things coolly, relying, it seems, on
the old adage which says that "he who drives with oxen also gets
there." While they early built fairly good houses, they were slow in
erecting buildings and comfortable places for their horses and cattle,
and it was many years before they began to erect sheds and buildings
for their machinery. Wagons without spring seats sold at from $100.00
to $125.00; reapers and mowing machines were very expensive and they
were generally only a few of these in each neighborhood. The household
furniture was cheap and simple; there were no such things as furnaces
or hard coal burners. Mostly old stoves were in use for the burning of
wood, and these perhaps were second hand, or at least had seen better
days.

The young man in pioneer days generally started out in life with an ox
team, a breaking plow, and a wagon. The wages for breaking were from
$1.00 to $2.00 an acre, and when he was not breaking he would often be
running a threshing machine or working in the saw mill or in the timber
getting out logs. When ox teams were used for breaking, it took one to
drive and one to hold the plow in the ground. A person generally broke
more land than he could fence, and it was no use to sow wheat and not
fence, for in those days the law permitted cattle and horses to run at
large.

Corn was not cultivated on the new ground to any extent, except that
each one raised enough corn for his own use but no more. The corn was
generally put in by hand, plowed only once or twice with a single
shovel plow pulled by one old nag.

In the early days all the cooking was done by the open fireplace; such
an article as a stove was not much known. Corn bread and pork, with rye
coffee, formed the average bill of fare at the wayside inn and at the
farm house. The boarders actually preferred pork to venison; they got
tired of game--it was so plentiful. Many a pioneer farmer could shoot
from five to ten deer near his door before breakfast.

In ye olden times nearly everyone would attend church, especially in
summer. While many did not belong to any church, yet they were all
interested in it. They supported the churches to the best of their
ability. The influence of the country church did much in making this a
county which still shows the effect of the early training and of the
efforts of itinerant preachers and laymen who went from place to place
visiting the scattered congregations. Such preachers as Troup, Searles,
Ingham, J. Hodges, Hayden, Twing, Maxin, Dudley, Rankin, Boal,
Cunningham, Keeler, Phelps, Roberts, Jones, Elias Skinner, Father
Emmons and many of the early itinerant ministers did much to build up
churches in this county. Then there were a number of laymen in various
denominations who maintained in part some of the associations
themselves, such as Tom Lewis, Levi Lewis, Chandler Jordan, Henry
Rogers, and the Kurtzes, Runkles, Shueys, and many of the early
settlers in and around Lisbon. The community around Mt. Vernon was also
much influenced by the college atmosphere and by the itinerant
preachers who visited the scattered members in Franklin township. These
are only a few of many such communities where an interest was kept up
in the small country churches where large congregations gathered weekly
for meditation and for prayer. Many old pioneer families did much to
help the church.

One can converse with the old pioneer now, and he still loves to recall
the old times, the old haunts and the wayside places. It was by some
rail fence that a rural maiden had whispered to him as a young man,
that the pain in her heart no human touch but his own could heal. It
was here loved ones had spoken as they chattered away in childish
whispers, when he came home from ended labors, and it was here that he
took his family on Sunday to the little church where they all bowed
silently in prayer, full of the faith and the hope which made his heart
strong and his footsteps light. The simple mode of living in Linn
county in an early date made strong men and courageous women. They were
brought up to withstand the temptations of life and to despise the
false veneer of a later generation. They lived up to the ideals of
their way of thinking, and left sturdy families who grew up in the
simple ways of the pioneer, themselves dutiful sons and daughters of
the old settlers who came here in any early day to make homes for
themselves and their descendants.

Truly, the pioneers should be remembered for what they accomplished,
for well might they sing with the poet:

     "Fading away like the stars of the morning,
       Losing our light in the rising sun;
     Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling
       Only remembered by what we have done."

CHAPTER XIV

_A Hero of the Canadian Rebellion_


What promised to have been a war to death in Linn county in the early
'40s terminated because one of our old settlers, then a young man, said
what he knew to be the fact and was willing to back it up with force.
The interesting story is as follows: Political dissension had prevailed
in Canada since 1820, and an open rebellion broke out in 1837. In lower
Canada it began among the French settlers who wanted equality and their
rights as Frenchmen, while in upper Canada it was brought about by
leaders of the radical party insisting on a democratic form of
government. The rebellion was lead by Lyon Mackenzie, a native of
Scotland who had taken up journalism in Canada. The spirit of rebellion
extended also into the United States, and many so-called filibusters
joined the insurrectionists from a spirit of adventure. The papers
mentioned in lengthy articles these so-called leaders, one especially
being given much notoriety, one William Johnson, who, after the
rebellion was put down, lived on one of the Thousand Islands in the St.
Lawrence and evaded capture. His daughter, Kate, it was said, brought
him food and the soldiers were unable to locate the hiding place of
this rebel who defied the government militia.

Robert Ellis met this so-called Bill Johnson at Prairie du Chien,
Wisconsin, in 1842. Johnson asserted with a great deal of gusto that he
had escaped from the Islands and was going to make his home among the
free people out on the borders. He was accompanied by a woman he
claimed to be his daughter who received as much attention as the
valiant soldier himself. Johnson drifted into Ft. Atkinson and finally
located on a claim two miles above Quasqueton, on the north bank of the
Wapsie river. Here he became a sort of feudal lord, told exaggerated
stories about his valor, and was surrounded by a number of frontier
soldiers who claimed to have fought in the war of 1812, as well as in
the Canadian rebellion. For a time Captain Bill Johnson was idolized as
no other person in this part of Iowa, and it is certain that his
daughter Kate was laid siege to by more than one border hero under the
guise of suitor.

It was not long until the arrogant ways of Captain Bill Johnson, who
jumped a claim, offended an old settler by the name of Henry Bennett,
who resided near Quasqueton, and who was one of the first settlers in
that community. Attempted arrests were made pro and con, but the
Bennett party was successful and they drove Captain Johnson out of the
community, after a sound flogging. He drifted into Marion and put up at
the Phillips Hotel, telling stories of Bennett's abuse, how his
property had been taken, and how he had been driven out of the county
like a criminal. He wanted redress. The good people of Marion believed
these stories, and soon a company was organized and provided with
weapons of war to surround Bennett and demand restitution. A number of
the old settlers of Marion were mustered into this company, such as
George Patterson, Col. Durham, and others of the well known residents.
It was in the winter of 1843, but that did not keep any of the company
away from a forced march to Quasqueton. Bennett had friends and
admirers also, and being made aware of the proposed attack he fortified
his camp, laid in a supply of food, and had his guns ready. The
attacking party demanded restitution, but the old man shook his head
and told them to come on. The besiegers had to camp out, while
Bennett's followers were well housed and warm. Finally the attacking
army ran out of provisions, and after a council of war in which the
peace loving spirit prevailed, they decided to return to the quiet
haunts of Marion.

Johnson still kept up his abuse of Bennett and his friends, and when
that did not satisfy would resort to tales of his wonderful escapades
on the St. Lawrence and how he had evaded the British officers with the
assistance of his daughter, Kate. The good people at first entertained
him as a guest, and he was always willing to accept of their
hospitality, but stories were circulated that this so-called daughter,
Kate, was not his daughter at all. But Bill Johnson still remained,
having a number of supporters.

One night Robert Ellis entered the Phillips Hotel while Johnson was
heaping abuse on the Bennett party and on the courts of Iowa, telling
Gen. James Wilson, who was surveyor-general of the territory, the story
of his abuse. He said, that the day before he and his crowd had tracked
Bennett as far as Delhi where the party escaped, being assisted by
William Abbe, a prominent settler of Linn county. This was too much for
Ellis, and he replied as follows: "That is not true, as Wm. Abbe drove
from Ft. Atkinson with me, and we arrived in Marion today, and we were
together all of the time." Johnson was full of "wrath and cabbage." He
arose and in a much injured manner said, "You might as well call me a
liar as to say that," to which Ellis replied, "If that suits you any
better I can call you a liar, because that is what you are, if you want
us to believe what you have been saying here tonight. You have been
telling lies about my friend Abbe." Johnson pulled off his coat and was
about to strike him, when Mr. Ellis spied a hickory stick in the wood
box. With that he went after Johnson, who quietly retreated, put on his
coat, engaged in conversation with Wilson, and the matter for the time
dropped. The story leaked out that this Canadian boaster was nothing
but a coward, and there were grave doubts as to whether or not he was
the person he claimed to be. Finally so much opposition arose against
him that he left Marion--much to the satisfaction of the people of the
county for they had seen and heard things which reflected against
Johnson's relations with his so-called daughter.

In 1849 Robert Ellis drifted into the gold camps of Sacramento Valley
on the American river, and who should he find out there but the
daughter of Bill Johnson, now the wife of one of the miners. He learned
that Bill Johnson had drifted into Southern Iowa and Missouri, where he
assumed his old attitude, expecting free board and considerable
consideration, but the pioneers in that community had to be "shown" and
cared not much for what Johnson had been; the question was what he was
then. A suitor in Mahaska county came to see his alleged daughter, but
Bogus Johnson opposed and threatened him with dire disaster if he came
within shooting distance. The suitor was not at all scared, having
lived on the frontier longer than Johnson. The woman may have regretted
the double life she had been living, and perhaps with her
assistance--no one knows--Johnson was killed in a quarrel by the
suitor, it was alleged, and prosecutions followed. The suitor and Kate
after a long trial then drifted to California, and there Robert Ellis
found them and heard the story that Captain Bill Johnson, once the
terror of this part of Iowa, was a bogus Bill Johnson, and the light
haired Kate was not the Kate of story and fiction at all. If it had not
been for the obstreperous Bennett on the Wapsie and for the hickory
stick in the hands of Robert Ellis bogus Bill Johnson might have
terrorized this community much longer than he did.

Another story was also told shortly after Johnson left by one of
Johnson's henchmen, an old soldier, which shows the bad character and
disposition of Johnson. William Abbe, one of the early settlers, and at
one time a member of the legislature of Iowa, being in the employ of
the government, having a contract to deliver provisions at Ft.
Atkinson, was about to return to his home in Linn Grove, which fact was
known to Johnson. The soldier related after Johnson's hasty departure
that he and Johnson had entered into an agreement to blackmail Abbe and
get some money out of him by inviting Abbe to remain in the Johnson
cabin over night and then to threaten Abbe that he had assaulted the
daughter of Johnson while accepting of his hospitality. Johnson was to
remain in hiding while the soldier was set out on the trail to watch
for Abbe and invite him to the cabin. This was done and the soldier sat
out in the timber watching for Abbe during the afternoon and evening,
but fortunately Abbe failed to make his appearance as expected and the
deep laid plan fell through.

Bill Johnson, whatever he may have been, was certainly an expert in his
line and seemed to ingratiate himself into the good graces of many
prominent people. He obtained the assistance and help of Governor
Chambers, as well as Surveyor-General James Wilson, and many others in
the various law suits which he had with the members of the Bennett
party. General Wilson, as is well known, was a native of New Hampshire
and on account of the personal friendship of Daniel Webster had been
appointed to this office by President Harrison. Webster had intended to
slate his friend Wilson for Governor of Iowa, but Harrison had
appointed his private secretary and former aide-de camp, Colonel John
Chambers. Thus General Wilson had to accept the only vacancy left, that
of surveyor-general. On his trip over Iowa, General Wilson was
accompanied by his daughter, Mary E. Wilson, better known as Mrs. John
Sherwood, who later became one of the best known writers and society
women on two continents. It was at Marion, according to the report of
Robert Ellis, that Johnson first met General Wilson and that the
friendship sprang up between them, and it seemed as though Johnson had
known a number of Wilson's relatives and a great many of the prominent
men in New England. It is thought, of course, that Johnson imposed upon
General Wilson and no doubt used the names of parties he had known of
in some way to further his own selfish purposes.

The following may be quoted from the _History of Washington County_.
Vol. I, p. 326, as told by H. A. Burrell:

     "A Mahaska county murder case of Job Peck, the murderer of
     Wm. Johnson, came here on a change of venue September 9,
     1843; it was a melodrama: A cultivated Canadian
     revolutionist, a beautiful girl Kit claiming to be his
     daughter, horsethieves, etc., being the personae dramatis, an
     elopement and kidnapping constituting the action of the
     piece. The Canuck was shot in his cabin and a lover of Kit
     was held for the crime. Kit was spirited to Pittsburg, Pa.,
     and the lover proved an alibi; he had married Kit near
     Fairfield. While in jail here he did not know his bride's
     whereabouts nor for several months after, but he finally
     found her with fine people. They lived near Oskaloosa for
     years when they went to California. Who she was, was never
     known; she denied that Johnson was her father; he may have
     been her husband. After Peck's death she married again and
     had a noble family and was called the Queen of the Thousand
     Isles--in oil business. Johnson was the subject of state
     correspondence between the United States and England. A
     British subject, he revolted, turned renegade and spy in
     1812, and robbed the mails to get information. Both
     countries offered a reward for him and he fled to the
     Isles."

How much truth there is in the above it is difficult to say. It is at
least based on hearsay. Colonel Durham knew Johnson well and was one of
his friends in the Quasqueton affair, and Robert Ellis also knew him,
as well as the members of the Abbe family. Whether Johnson was a
Canadian or a citizen of the United States or had anything to do with
the war of 1812 is uncertain. At least in Linn county he claimed to be
the Bill Johnson of Canadian fame. For that reason he introduced this
young woman as his daughter to carry out the story, as the original
Johnson did have a daughter who carried news as well as food to him in
his hiding.

To supplement the above account may be mentioned the following from the
"Early History of Dubuque," as written by L. H. Langworthy, and printed
in the _Iowa Journal of History and Politics_, July, 1910:

     "In 1843 a most ludicrous affair occurred. A villainous
     fellow palmed himself upon the people of Buchanan county as
     the renowned patriot and celebrated hero of the Thousand
     Isles, Bill Johnson. This man, with his daughter Miss Kate
     Johnson, was suspected, it seems, of being any other than
     the far-famed Canadian patriot, by the citizens of Buchanan
     county, who thought fit to take Johnson out in the night,
     tie him to a tree and whip him severely with fifty lashes on
     his naked back. The offenders were arraigned before Judge
     Wilson. The court house was crowded by hundreds of eager
     spectators who listened with intense interest to the
     proceedings: all anxious to see the laws of our country
     administered faithfully. The prisoners' names were Evans,
     Spencer, Parrish, and Rowley, charged with burglary and
     riot. It appeared that these defendants accompanied by
     several other white men and five or six Indians after
     lynching Johnson, ordered him and his daughter to pack up
     their goods and be off in two hours, and not to return at
     the peril of their lives. Great sympathy was felt for this
     Johnson and the two tender females of his household, who
     were thrown out in the depth of winter and obliged to travel
     twenty-five miles over a cold and bleak prairie; so cold
     that it froze one of the lynchers themselves to death,
     another lost his feet, and several others were severely
     frozen. The citizens here declared that Johnson looked as if
     he was born to command, and betokened in every action that
     he was the same old Bill Johnson, the hero of the Thousand
     Isles, the Canadian patriot, and the great friend of human
     liberty and republican institutions; while all the young
     bloods of the town declared that Miss Kate Johnson was a
     very intelligent and interesting young lady, with rare
     accomplishments, agreeable manners and the worthy daughter
     of a gallant sire. The case was conducted on the part of the
     prosecution by James Crawford and General James Wilson; on
     the part of the defense by James Churchman and I. M.
     Preston: the counsel on both sides in their speeches were
     truly eloquent, they were fine efforts of legal talent, and
     so great was the interest taken in this trial that the
     ladies attended in goodly numbers until a late hour at
     night, determined to hear all the proceedings and speeches
     to which the occasion gave rise. Miss Kate Johnson received
     great attention and unequalled admiration as the celebrated
     heroine and daughter of the renowned patriot of the Thousand
     Isles. The jury after being out a short time returned a
     verdict of guilty; one was sentenced to the penitentiary for
     two years and the others to a fine of two hundred dollars,
     which imprisonment and fines however were afterwards
     remitted; for lo, and behold! the next thing we hear of the
     hero of the isles, is that he has grossly imposed himself
     upon the citizens of the place, he being a different man
     altogether from the Bill Johnson whom he represented, of a
     different name and style of character, a great thief and
     scoundrel. Letters were received showing these facts. The
     next news received from him by our crestfallen beaux of
     Dubuque, was that a Mr. Peck, a respectable man in Mahaska
     county, the place to which the family had removed, fell in
     love with Johnson's daughter, the heroic Kate, who returned
     his love. But old Bill would not give his consent to the
     marriage. So the two turtles fled to an adjoining county
     where they were united in bonds matrimonial. It was some
     time before the reputed father knew where his reputed
     daughter had gone. But as soon as he did, he pursued her and
     entered the house of Peck with pistol in hand and took her
     away unmolested. But a few days afterwards while Johnson was
     sitting in his own house he was shot through the heart with
     a rifle ball from between the chinks of the logs. Peck was
     arrested, but on trial acquitted. The lineage of the heroine
     was traced back to an obscure family in Ohio, her history
     and romance closing alike in contempt and infamy.

[Illustration: BARNEY McSHANE CABIN Built in 1847 Near Springville]

[Illustration: CABIN IN "CRACKER SETTLEMENT" NEAR MT. VERNON]

     "The young swains, and especially the editorial gallants,
     who were so greatly enamored with the charms of Miss
     Katherine Johnson while in our city, often rallied each
     other afterwards on the subject; and some who appeared from
     their newspaper eulogies to be the most moon-struck while
     the romance lasted, and had written the largest amount of
     very soft poetry on the lovely daughter of the hero of the
     Thousand Isles, were the first to forget the object of their
     adoration. Alas for the fickleness of man's affection and
     the mutability of his attachments."

The above tells the story of how much trouble the various communities
in Iowa had with bogus Bill Johnson and the various interpretations of
the life and character of the outlaw and his alleged daughter. Mr.
Ellis still insists that his interpretation of the life and character
of this outlaw is as he tells it and no one perhaps knew the principal
characters better than he did. Mr. Ellis was the first one who met
Johnson in Wisconsin as he was about to emigrate into Iowa. He was one
of the actors in the occurrence at the Phillips House in Marion, he was
the old friend and companion of William Abbe and knew most of the men
in the Bennett party, such as Evans, Parrish, Rowley, and others, and
he met in California many years afterwards the heroine who had become
the wife of Peck and there had a conversation with both of them. Mr.
Ellis is of the opinion that when Johnson suddenly left Marion he went,
to Missouri and later drifted back into Mahaska county, Iowa, where he
was murdered. It was thought that Kate knew more about the murder than
she let on, but living a life as she had lived it would not be best for
her to tell all she knew of the various transactions with her so-called
father. So far as Mr. Ellis ascertained Kate had reformed and carried
herself in goodly repute among the miners of the far west where she was
then known, it is said, at times as the Queen of the Thousand Isles.
Her husband, it is stated, was a reputable person and had always stood
well in the community up to the time of the Johnson murder, and what
part, if any, he took in that no one ever knew.

Bogus Bill Johnson is said to be buried in an unknown grave in Mahaska
county and no stone has ever been found that marked his last resting
place.

Kate, Queen of the Thousand Isles, sleeps in one of the mountain
valleys of the Sierras on the Pacific slope and no one knows just when
she died or where she was buried. The dual lives of the characters in
this drama ended as all such lives do end, in infamy and disgrace.




CHAPTER XV

_The Newspapers of the County_

BY FREDERICK J. LAZELL


From the days of the early settlers until now the newspapers of Linn
county have been among the most potent factors in the upbuilding of the
community. They have been, as a rule, constructive newspapers. Their
mission has been to build up, to help their communities grow in wealth
and influence. The newspapers of the county have been noted for their
sagacity and their breadth of vision, their conservatism and their
tolerance. They have exerted a strong and a wholesome influence upon
this and adjoining counties. In the state at large their influence for
good has not been small.

The old adage that the good die young has not been true of Linn
county's newspapers. The best papers today are those which were started
in the earliest days of the various towns in this county. They have
prospered as their respective communities have prospered. Their
publishers and editors have been, for the most part, men with personal
and property interests in their respective communities. That is why
they have been builders and boosters. Linn county's proud position
among the counties of the state, commercially, intellectually, and
politically, is largely due to the fact that men of ability and
integrity have worked and written and fought for the things they knew
would be helpful to their constituents. And this is as true of the
weekly newspapers as it is of the daily press. Very few counties in the
state have had such an able corps of newspaper writers.

There were some weaklings, papers which were born and soon died. There
have been a few freak newspapers. But not many. There have also been
many able, brilliant young newspaper men who did good work in the Linn
county editorial and newspaper offices for awhile and then left for
larger fields of labor. Some of the county's ablest politicians and
some of its most prominent business men have occasionally dabbled in
newspapering, for the sake of some party or some pet project they were
anxious to push through. That was in the earlier days. There has been
very little of it in the county of late years.

In the main the newspaper men of the county have been men to the manner
born, with a knowledge of the business from the ground up, men to whom
the smell of printer's ink is as essential to their enjoyment of life
as the scent of the sea to a sailor. If, as Elbert Hubbard tells us,
art is the expression of man's joy in his work, then nine-tenths of the
newspaper men of Linn county have been real artists, for they have
stuck to their papers when they might have made heaps more money in
some other line of business. But this love of the work so
characteristic among the brethren of the Linn county press doubtless
has something to do with the fact that their readable papers are read
and quoted by the readers of other papers, from one end of the state to
the other.

No chronological list of the newspapers of Linn county has been
published, but it is interesting and instructive, and worthy of
preservation in permanent form:

     1851 _The Progressive Era_, started by D. O. Finch, in Cedar
     Rapids.

     1852 _The Prairie Star_, started at Marion by A. Hoyt. Same
     year the name was changed to the _Linn County Register_, by
     J. H. and G. H. Jennison.

     1854 Name of the _Progressive Era_ changed to the _Cedar
     Valley Times_. J. L. Enos assumes control.

     1856 _Cedar Valley Farmer_ started in Cedar Rapids by J. L.
     Enos. This was a monthly agricultural paper.

     _Cedar Rapids Democrat_, started at Cedar Rapids by W. W.

Much of the early history of Linn county, and more especially of Cedar
Rapids, is interwoven with the history of the _Progressive Era_, which
afterwards became the _Cedar Rapids Times_. The _Progressive Era_ was
established by D. O. Finch in 1851. It was democratic in politics and
claimed to be devoted to the interests of Cedar Rapids and Linn county.
It was a seven column, four page paper, and rather a credit to the town
at that time. Worse papers have been published since.

It was but a short time until Mr. Finch had all the newspaper
experience he wanted. Joseph Greene then purchased the paper and ran it
until 1854. During this time Ezra Van Metre, James J. Child, Esq., and
James L. Enos were successively its editors.

James L. Enos had something to do with nearly every paper that was
started during the early days of Linn county. He loved the smell of
printer's ink. The types had a fascination for him. He delighted to see
his thoughts reproduced in print. In September, 1854, he and F.
Augustus Williams purchased Mr. Greene's interest in the _Progressive
Era_. They changed the name to the _Cedar Valley Times_. They changed
the politics of the paper from democratic to the new Americanism of
that time. Then came the organization of the republican party. Like
other adherents to the American party living in the north, the editors
of the _Times_ cast in their lot with the new republican party and
warmly advocated and defended the principles on which it was founded.

One J. G. Davenport figures also in the early history of the _Times_.
He had acquired an interest in the paper, and during the campaign he
was its nominal editor, although there were not wanting those who
declared that he had not the ability to write a three line notice of a
church supper, let alone an editorial. Anyway, he made the _Times_ his
stepping stone into the postmaster's seat, and his conduct of that
office was such that an investigation of his shortages followed. His
bondsmen, one of whom was the late J. J. Snouffer, made good the loss,
and shortly afterwards Davenport, after some more operations of a minor
character and similar nature, left Cedar Rapids.

They were rare old political fighters in those days. Politics, rather
than news, was the chief end and aim of the owner of a newspaper. When
Greene, Merritt & Co. closed out Davenport, having held a bill of sale
on the _Times_ office, the Times was made the personal organ of Colonel
William H. Merritt in his campaign against Kirkwood. To do this it had
to change from republicanism to democracy, but it waged a hot fight,
Colonel Merritt being its editor. However, Kirkwood was elected and in
1862 C. M. Hollis purchased the _Times_ and he made great success of it
up to 1866 when he disposed of the paper to Ayers and McClelland.

Much might be written about some of the old printers who helped to
publish those early Linn county newspapers. There has been a host of
them and they have included some notable men. One was no less a
personage than Mr. Rosewater, of the Omaha Bee, who once worked as a
journeyman printer in the office of the _Slovan-Americky_. It was when
he was on his way to the west. Some of the old printers have long since
passed away. One of the latest of them was Stephen M. Jones, who died
at Hampton four years ago. Concerning his work here in Cedar Rapids,
Captain J. O. Stewart, himself one of the veteran printers of the
state, writes interestingly as follows:

     "Stephen Jones commenced to learn the trade in the
     _Progressive Era_ office in this city, in the year 1851,
     serving a four years' apprenticeship, at the end of which
     time he went to Vinton and worked in the _Eagle_ office, at
     that time conducted by Fred Layman, I believe. The office of
     the _Progressive Era_ was located on the corner of First
     street and Third avenue, where the Warfield-Pratt-Howell
     wholesale building now stands, and was the first paper
     published in Cedar Rapids. It was an old frame building
     erected by the Greene brothers and formerly used as a store
     room. At the time of this story the lower floor front was
     used on Sundays by the Episcopal church for service, the
     printing office was overhead and the back part, three
     stories, including basement, was used as a store room for
     dressed hogs. 'Steve,' as he was called, and your
     correspondent were what was known as 'printer's devils.'
     After some years residence in Vinton Steve got about a
     wheelbarrow load of material and started his paper in
     Hampton and christened it the _Hampton Chronicle_, which is
     still among the live, able newspapers in Iowa. He was later
     appointed postmaster of Hampton, which position he held for
     twelve years.

     "There is one other who would rank with us if he is still
     living, and he was a few years ago, on his farm near Lone
     Tree in Johnson county. His name is Dan Shaffer. Dan, with a
     Mr. Foster, whose first name I have forgotten, were employed
     in the office doing the work on the Iowa Supreme Court
     Reports by Justice George Greene, formerly of this city.
     This was a book of some 600 or more pages and an edition of
     500 volumes. This book can be found on the shelves of many
     of the Iowa lawyers, especially the older practitioners.
     This work was all done on a Washington hand press and 500
     impressions was considered a good day's work. Steve's
     principal business, until he was relieved by the writer, was
     to ink the forms from which the impressions were made. This
     was done by passing over the type forms two large rollers
     made of glue and molasses, leaving and returning onto a
     large wooden roller revolved by a crank at one end, which
     process equally distributed the ink which was applied to the
     two rollers by a still smaller one and designated the
     'brayer'--old printers will recognize the article. For
     nearly two years this was the principal part of the writer's
     duties, interspersed with hunting up and down the banks of
     the river dragging out floating slabs that got away from the
     saw mills up at the dam, for fuel for the office, the
     proprietors being too poor to buy cordwood at $1.75 per
     cord. The paper was published by Dan O. Finch who later
     became distinguished as a lawyer of high ability. The last I
     knew of him, a few years ago, he was still living, making
     his home with a son some place on the Pacific
     coast,--Seattle, I believe. The other publisher was William
     Williams, son of Chief Justice Williams of this state. The
     material was owned by the Greene brothers. Some time later
     the _Era_ office was moved to the building that stood on the
     corner where the Rudolph store now is. The proprietors
     changed hands pretty often, and finally the paper came into
     the hands of Robert and LeRoy McCabe, older brothers of the
     famous Chaplain Charles C. McCabe, who then clerked for
     Greene Bros. in their store under the printing office. The
     Masonic lodge room was in the third story of this building.
     While the McCabe brothers conducted the paper your
     correspondent graduated and started out as a full fledged
     journeyman printer. It may be of interest to the craft of
     the day to give your correspondent's salary. The first year
     he was to receive $35, second $50, third $75, and the fourth
     the princely sum of $100. Out of this he was supposed to
     pay his board and furnish his clothing. The first job he
     secured after his apprenticeship was $10 per week and pay
     his own board. This was in the year 1856.

     "The tramping jour. printers of those days, like Bret
     Harte's Heathen Chinee, were peculiar. As a class they were
     the best of workmen; bright and intelligent, knowing the
     'art preservative' thoroughly, but possessed of that roving
     disposition so common to all printers of that time, and many
     of them given to drink. They would work for a time and get a
     little ahead and then get on a 'toot' and seek newer fields.
     They often resorted to peculiar methods to procure a job. I
     recall an incident while I was yet the 'devil' of the _Era_
     office. It was on the day we were moving the office to the
     new quarters. The heavy press and material had to be skidded
     from the second floor to the ground through a large door in
     the front of the building. When the heavier part of the
     press was partly down a rather tall, strong built,
     intelligent looking man put in an appearance. He watched the
     process for a short time not saying a word. Finally he took
     from his pocket a slip of dirty paper and wrote on it 'don't
     you need some help?' and handed it to the proprietor, Mr.
     Robert McCabe. He was asked if he could talk. His reply was
     simply by signs indicating that he was deaf and dumb. He
     proved an excellent help and stayed for more than three
     months, never indicating that he could speak. He was a
     skilled printer, but cross and particular, and often we
     'devils' called him hard names to his face. But his time had
     come and he must have his periodical, and he did. He threw
     his money to the kids on the streets and had a jolly time,
     never once indicating he could speak. About the third day he
     came into the office and took Mr. McCabe to the lodge room
     above and wrote: 'What will they do to me if I talk?' Being
     assured that he would not be harmed and to the astonishment
     of the boss he reached out his hand and exclaimed, 'How are
     you, Bob?' The same surprise was waiting for the rest of us,
     and you may be assured we 'devils,' who had been giving him
     such choice names, were looking for a chance to hide. He
     soon left and I never heard of him again.

     "As I have said, the publishers changed often, and for some
     time after the McCabe brothers left the paper it was hard to
     tell just who did manage the paper, the Greenes owning the
     material. After many vicissitudes, which all the papers of
     that early day had to pass through, it fell into the hands
     of Joseph Davenport, a practical printer who associated with
     him James L. Enos, well known and well remembered by the
     earlier settlers, who changed the name of the paper and
     re-christened it the _Cedar Valley Times_. Later it was
     changed to the _Cedar Rapids Times_, and was, after changing
     hands many times, finally owned by Dr. McClelland and L. M.
     Ayers, who published it for years, when it finally died of
     old age, owned and published by Dr. McClelland. The old
     _Progressive Era_ was the original progenitor of your
     present _Daily Times_."

Full of interest are those old files of the _Times_ which deal with the
beginning of the war period in the history of Linn county. There is the
description of a "democratic field day" in Cedar Rapids, October 10,
1860, when Stephen A. Douglas came over from Iowa City and spoke to the
multitude. Bands came from Vinton and Mt. Vernon; drum corps from
Bertram and Cedar Rapids. A local merchant bought a barrel of good
whiskey, diluted it sufficiently to accommodate the capacity of the six
thousand who made up the audience, sold all of it and counted the
meeting as the best thing which ever had happened in Cedar Rapids.
There was a parade of the "Wide-awakes" that night, and the visiting
bands remained over to furnish a part of the inspiration. There were
big posters, beginning with the couplet

     "O, dinna ye hear the slogan, boys?
     'Tis Douglas and his men."

That gave the editor of the _Times_ an opportunity to write the first
scare head which ever appeared in a Cedar Rapids newspaper. With the
true newspaper instinct he remembered that slogan and used it for a
sting at the end of the headline. This was the headline the week of the
election:

     "ELECTION OVER

     ABRAHAM LINCOLN IS PRESIDENT-ELECT

     Shout the Glad Tidings, Exultingly Sing; Old Abe is Elected
     and Cotton Ain't King--Secession Rebuked--Popular
     Sovereignty Now Here--Fusion Worse Confounded--The Bell
     Tolling for the Dead--Union Preserved--Dinna Ye Hear the
     Slogan."

Mr. C. M. Hollis, who was editor of the _Cedar Valley Times_ from 1862
to 1866, gives an illuminating insight into the history of Linn county
during the early days of the war:

     "My office in Cedar Rapids was naturally the meeting place
     of politicians. There the men who controlled or sought to
     control got together and talked plainly. And the plain talk
     of politicians is very different from the phrasings which
     they use in public speeches. It was thus that our Linn
     county leaders reasoned. 'This war is becoming something in
     which the whole people have intense interest. They will
     judge of men from the fact of participation or opposition.
     When the struggle is over the men who control in politics
     will be those who have been soldiers.' And so these men went
     after commissions. They were wise and far-seeing and reaped
     reward of their prudence as well as of their valor. I saw
     the commission of one Linn county man made out for the
     majoralty in an Iowa regiment, not only before the regiment
     had been organized, but even before a single company had
     been raised. I saw another for a colonelcy, fixed out ahead
     in the same way, by reason of political grace and pull. Not
     but what these men, and others, made good officers. I am
     only explaining the reasoning which prompted some of them to
     enter service, and the means which were most efficacious in
     securing prominent places.

     "And after a time it was considered that to get a high
     commission was tantamount to drawing a big political prize.
     Men were thus rewarded for their assistance given to
     successful candidates, and opponents found their way to army
     prominence beset with many obstacles. You know that a
     movement was started in Linn county to defeat Kirkwood for
     governor for the second term. This developed considerable
     strength, and a ticket was nominated with William H. Merritt
     of Cedar Rapids at its head. Merritt had been
     lieutenant-colonel of the First Iowa, and his was known as
     the 'fusion' ticket. It was an attempt to combine 'war
     democrats' and some elements of the republican party.
     Kirkwood was successful, and those men who had sought his
     defeat were, naturally, persona non grata with the state
     government. When commissions were going they were not
     remembered. Seymour D. Carpenter was one of these. But he
     did finally become surgeon of a regiment, because there was
     crying need for surgeons. Then when he was away from
     gubernatorial influence promotion was rapid, and the doctor
     was given a position as medical director of a department.
     Ellsworth N. Bates was another who suffered because of
     participation in the anti-Kirkwood movement. Mr. Bates
     persisted, however, and his merits and standing could not be
     ignored. He was elected captain of a company. With his
     regiment he served with more than usual credit, until he
     sickened and came home to die. There were others in Cedar
     Rapids and in Linn county who had similar experiences. Some
     of those who are still living, if they would but give full
     statements, would verify my remark that the proportion of
     politics mixed with the patriotism of those times was
     greater than is generally known.

     "Speaking of Ellsworth N. Bates recalls to mind one whose
     name deserves to be remembered in Cedar Rapids and in Linn
     county. He came to the town fresh from college. He was a
     real scholar and a man of rare natural abilities. He had the
     art of making friends--of gaining and retaining esteem of
     all who knew him. He was one of the very best public
     speakers I have ever heard--quick to respond to varying
     occasion, with ready thought and a phenomenal command of
     language. His choice of words and use of appropriate imagery
     made his addresses models of their kind. As a lawyer he met
     with instant success. He represented Linn county in the
     legislature, and was acknowledged as a strong man among the
     law-makers. He made a splendid fight for the state
     senatorship candidacy, against H. G. Angle. He was assistant
     secretary of the second constitutional convention of Iowa.
     When the war broke out he was one of those who did much to
     rouse sentiment for support of the government. Then he
     raised Company A of the Twentieth, and proved himself a real
     soldier in camp and field. When he came home, near to death,
     he had lost none of his old enthusiasm. He and I were
     intimate friends, and to me he told his plans for the
     future. Had E. N. Bates lived, I know that he would have
     ranked among the real statesmen of Iowa. As it was he
     accomplished more and had greater influence upon
     contemporaneous affairs than many whose deeds are very
     carefully preserved."

Mr. Hollis also tells us how newspapers were made in that awful period
of the nation's history:

     "We were not sensationalists in those days. The events that
     we had to chronicle needed no trickery of headlines or large
     type to command attention. Here are the lists of dead and
     wounded in an Iowa regiment at the battle of Winchester,"
     and the old editor opened a file of the _Times_ for 1864-65.
     "Do you think it needed a flaming poster effect to secure
     reading of that column? There are the names of friends and
     neighbors. To some of the readers of that paper those names
     represented their dearest ones. Those who had brothers or
     fathers, or sons or sweethearts in that regiment read over
     the battle lists with a fearful anxiety. We were giving
     weekly chronicle of facts--they have not yet been arranged
     into the order of definite history. When we wrote editorials
     it was not pretended that we understood all there was to the
     struggle. Only when and where we caught the partial views or
     grasped the immediate meaning of some development we gave
     our opinions. These may have been prejudiced by our personal
     sentiments or our political affiliations, but I believe, as
     a rule, the editorial utterances of those years were from
     the souls of the writers and had the ring of sincerity. And,
     with but few exceptions, the newspapers of Iowa were loyal.
     They directed or seconded loyal sentiment on all occasions.
     Few of the editors of those weeklies gained wealth or
     distinction, but they deserve to be remembered for a
     splendid work. They, too, are among 'the forgotten
     worthies.' It cost money to run even a weekly paper during
     the war years. When I began as publisher of the _Times_
     print paper cost $6 a bundle; before the war was over I was
     paying $16 for the same quality and amount. And wages ran up
     and up, as printers were more difficult to secure; until I
     was paying double what I had first found necessary."

At the close of the war the newspapers of the county began to turn
their attention to other evils. A wave of temperance sentiment swept
the county, and some of the editors were foremost among the fighters.
The county was aroused by the great amount of crime. Much of it
emanated from Cedar Rapids. "Can we expect," asked one writer in Cedar
Rapids, "peace and quiet in a place of 3,000 inhabitants which supports
not fewer than nineteen liquor establishments and several houses of ill
fame and does not support a single reading room nor a public library?"

[Illustration: ALEXANDER LAURANCE Long Prominent in Cedar Rapids]

Then, as now, the newspapers were the best "boosters" of their
respective communities. They were the first to point out the advantages
in each community and to suggest ways in which natural advantages might
lead to commercial growth and civic prosperity. Thus a writer in a
Cedar Rapids paper, after enumerating and commending the progress made
by the town since its organization, dwelt upon the value of the water
power, pointed out how the woolen mills then in operation might be made
more effective. There was an abundance of timber around Cedar Rapids at
that time and he advocated the establishment of saw mills in the city.
He saw no reason why staves should be brought all the way from Michigan
to Cedar Rapids, when they might as well be manufactured here at home.
He advocated that a packing house be established in this city, instead
of shipping the hogs from Cedar Rapids to Chicago and then shipping the
meat back. "This is only one item that would keep thousands of dollars
in our town that now go out," he argued. He wanted a hub and a spoke
factory, a fanning mill factory, and as for a "paper mill there is no
better point in the state."

History moves in ever repeating cycles and some of the things for which
this old editor fought are still needed today in Cedar Rapids and in
other towns of Linn county. But each cycle is better than the last.
Proof of this is seen in the dispute which was waged over freight rates
less than a decade after the Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska Railway had been
built into this city. The grain rates from Cedar Rapids to Chicago were
thirty cents a hundred pounds and the noise of protest which was made
then was quite similar to the noise which is sometimes


THE NEWSPAPER GRAVEYARD

The newspaper graveyard was established very early in the history of
the county and it is still claiming its victims. Among its early
victims was the _Cedar Rapids Democrat_. It was issued by W. W. Perkins
& Co. Somehow or other, democracy never flourished greatly in the Linn
county newspaper field, and the early democratic editors had not
learned the art of switching to a "progressive" side. So their papers
died. The _Democrat_ lived a year and a half. It deserved a better
fate, for it was well edited and printed.

In 1853 a monthly agricultural paper called the _Cedar Valley Farmer_
was commenced by James L. Enos. It lived through the first volume, but
a grave was opened for it before it had reached the tender age of two
years.

The _Voice of Iowa_ was commenced in January, 1857, under the auspices
of the Iowa Teachers and Phonetic associations, James L. Enos
editor-in-chief, assisted by a board of corresponding editors. It was
continued through two volumes and was then merged with another journal.

In the autumn of 1864 A. G. Lucas & Co. commenced the publication of
the _Cedar Rapids Atlas_. In January, 1865, it was changed to a weekly.
Then it was enlarged. Its place in the newspaper graveyard was prepared
a few weeks later. The editor and publisher had gone to study the
geography of other fields, but he did not take his debts with him. The
office was sold to satisfy them. This so weakened the shoulders of the
_Atlas_ that it was not strong enough to hold up.

The _Western World_ was born into a cold and unresponsive world, and
soon it joined the ranks of the dear departed.

Then came the _Linn County Signal_ which its authors hoped would be a
signal success. But its signals became tangled and it failed to kick
over the goal of success. It kicked the bucket instead. T. G. Newman,
the father of A. H. Newman of the Cedar Rapids Candy Company, purchased
the remains. From them he made the office of the _Daily Observer_,
with J. L. Enos as editor. From the _Observer_ came the _Cedar Rapids
Republican_. This was in 1870. In 1902 there was re-born the _Cedar
Rapids Times_. The father _Republican_ and the strong and lusty son
_Times_ are both in the full vigor of their powers, and this evolution
of the two powerful dailies from the amoeba-like weakly _Signal_ is the
most conspicuous example of newspaper evolution and the survival of the
fittest on record.

The present _Cedar Rapids Times_ is not to be confounded with the
_Cedar Rapids Weekly Times_ which had such a long and prosperous growth
under the management of Editor Hollis, and later of the good Doctor
McClelland. The _Weekly Times_ lived until the death of Doctor
McClelland, and it was a power for good. Then came two gentlemen from
Milwaukee who converted it into a daily. They had a great run as long
as their cash and their credit held out. And they were good newspaper
men, too. But they drew nearer and nearer the gateway to the great and
yawning newspaper graveyard. There were many mourners in Cedar Rapids
when the _Times_ was buried. It had been purified before its death by
its conspicuous work in a great tent revival conducted by an
evangelist, M. B. Williams. This revival the other dailies refused even
to mention. The _Times_ had a great deal of broadcloth endorsement. But
the eulogies proved to be its premature obituaries. Cash came slowly.
Advertising was coy. With the fall of the leaves came the death of the
_Times_. The _Gazette_ bought up the household furnishings, the
subscription lists and the good will. But the _Times_ was buried, and
the ghost of competition which had haunted the _Gazette_ office was
laid until the owners of the present _Evening Times_ resurrected the
name amid a riot of red ink during the strenuous municipal campaign of
1902.


STANDARD HAD A LONG LIFE

The _Cedar Rapids Standard_, like the _Cedar Valley Times_, had a long
life. It was first established in Marion in 1868, as the _Linn County
Signal_, by F. H. Williams. The following year it was removed to Cedar
Rapids, and Thomas G. Newman became the owner. In 1872 the name was
changed to the _Linn County Liberal_, and the office was moved back to
Marion. In 1873 James T. Simpkins became editor. The following year the
plant made a final trip to Cedar Rapids and was changed to the
_Standard_. For a long time it flourished, having a number of owners
and editors. Among them were Thomas G. Newman, C. E. Heath, A. H.
Newman, D. H. Ogden, H. A. Cook, Frank L. Millar, and in June, 1880,
Charles H. Playter, of the Des Moines _Daily Leader_, came to town and
bought a half interest of Mr. Millar. The firm name became Millar &
Playter. This partnership continued until the fall of 1885, when Mr.
Playter bought out his partner and became the sole owner. In the fall
of 1886 Mr. Playter sold the _Standard_ to S. B. Ayers, who conducted
it through the triumphal period of Iowa democracy, when Horace Boies
sat in the gubernatorial chair. It was a strong democratic paper and
had a large patronage in Linn county at that time. Later L. S. Saner
became the editor. But the hard times came. Rightly or wrongly they
were blamed on the democratic party. Republicanism triumphed; McKinley
was elected. The _Standard_ of the democratic party was trailed in the
dust. It soon died and took its place in the Cedar Rapids journalistic
graveyard.

The _Marion Pilot_ was established in 1871 at Mt. Vernon, as the _Linn
County Pilot_, and C. W. Kepler was editor. In 1874 the office was
removed to Marion and the paper was owned by Beatty & Whittits. It
continued under this management for several years and was one of the
strong republican papers of the county. In 1884 it was purchased by the
Rev. J. W. Chaffee and its name was changed to the _Marion Pilot_. He
built up a good paper, putting it in the front rank of the weekly
papers of the state. But with his passing from the editorial chair and
the rapid rise of the daily press in Cedar Rapids and its rival county
seat newspapers its power and prestige waned. In 1906 it yielded up
the ghost and was assigned to an honored place among those that have
passed on.


_The Good Ones Which Remain_

THE DAILY REPUBLICAN AND THE EVENING TIMES

As narrated above, the _Daily Republican_ is the outgrowth of the daily
_Observer_. In 1872 the _Observer_ was transferred to the Republican
Printing Company, and the name, which at first was the _Cedar Rapids
Republican_, was changed to the _Daily Republican_, the present name of
the paper.

A daily and weekly issue was published and the paper grew rapidly. For
a time it was edited by William B. Leach. In 1877 it passed into the
hands of the Republican Printing Company, who put in a great amount of
capital and enlarged the office. There were many editors during this
period. In March, 1881, the office was leased to J. R. Sage and D. G.
Goodrich, with an option of sale within a year. During this period the
paper was changed from an evening to a morning issue and an Associated
Press franchise was secured, giving the paper full news service.

Before the lease had expired Messrs. Sage and Goodrich had exercised
their right to purchase the plant. On March 1, 1882, it was transferred
to J. R. Sage, Johnson Brigham, Fred Benzinger, and H. P. Keyes. This
quartette reorganized the old Republican Printing Company, with J. R.
Sage as president. Nearly two years later Mr. Sage transferred his
interest to Mr. Brigham, and later on Messrs. Keyes and Benzinger
transferred their interest to L. S. Merchant. Messrs. Brigham and
Merchant conducted the paper, Mr. Merchant as business manager and Mr.
Brigham as editor, until 1892, when Mr. Brigham sold his interest and
went to Des Moines to start the first Iowa literary magazine, the
_Midland Monthly_. Mr. Sage had previously gone to Des Moines to become
the director of the Iowa weather and crop service.

Mr. Brigham's interest was purchased by Luther A. Brewer, who had been
assistant business manager, W. R. Boyd, who had done some editorial
work for the paper while living at home in Cedar county, and by L. S.
Merchant. The paper was at the beginning of what seemed to be an
uninterrupted period of ownership and prosperity when death suddenly
claimed Mr. Merchant in 1894. Mrs. Merchant retained her husband's
interest and the paper went on as before and waged a fight against free
silver in the campaign of 1896 which made it nationally prominent. Mr.
Brewer in the meantime had built up a very large job printing and book
binding department.

In 1898 the entire plant was sold to H. G. McMillan, of Rock Rapids, at
that time United States district attorney, and Cyrenus Cole, who had
for many years been associate editor of the _Iowa State Register_. Mr.
Boyd became postmaster at Cedar Rapids, but Mr. Brewer remained with
the paper as its business manager for some time. An evening edition,
the _Evening Times_, was started in 1902, and made a rapid growth. It
now has the largest circulation of any daily paper in Cedar Rapids.

In 1907 Mr. Brewer left the business and opened up a big book-making
plant of his own known as The Torch Press. In July of the same year
however, The Torch Press bought out the interest of Mr. McMillan and
the _Daily Republican_ and the _Evening Times_ have since been owned
and published by Messrs. Brewer and Cole. The substantial building on
Second avenue which had been erected during the regime of Messrs.
Brigham and Merchant proved far too small and the property was sold. A
large and modern newspaper and book-making building, four stories high,
was erected at the corner of Fourth avenue and Third street, the
present home of the _Daily Republican_, the _Evening Times_, The Torch
Press Printery and Bindery, and The Torch Press Book-shop, which
latter is managed by William Harvey Miner and is the biggest and most
largely patronized book shop west of Chicago.


THE EVENING GAZETTE

There is not a great deal of "history" concerning the Cedar Rapids
_Evening Gazette_, which has been one of the conspicuous successes
among Iowa daily newspapers since it was started in 1883. On June 10 of
that year, the daily _Gazette_ was founded by Messrs. Otis and Post. A
weekly issue of the paper was started at the same time. In March, 1884,
the Gazette Company was organized, and in July of that year the entire
stock was purchased by Messrs. Fred W. Faulkes and Clarence L. Miller.
The paper has had the same ownership ever since that time. The late
editor Faulkes was a pungent and versatile writer, and under his
editorial management the _Gazette_ rapidly rose to a commanding
position in the Iowa newspaper field. It began as a republican
newspaper. But after the memorable Frank D. Jackson campaign in 1893
Editor Faulkes became estranged from Governor Jackson and some of the
other leaders of the republican party. Thereafter he was inclined to
espouse the cause of democracy and the _Gazette_ came to be regarded as
the democratic newspaper of Linn county. Still later it grew more
independent, in matters of politics.

Since the death of Fred Faulkes the _Gazette_ has been published under
the supervision of its business manager Clarence L. Miller. Like the
other dailies of the city it has abandoned the weekly field.


THE SATURDAY RECORD

The _Saturday Record_ is the outgrowth of a little amateur paper
started away back in 1879 by Ralph Van Vechten, at present
vice-president of the Continental and Commercial National Bank of
Chicago. He was then a student with a taste for printer's ink and he
started a little literary paper, known as the _Stylus_. Soon after that
he was joined by Arthur J. Huss, and the two of them ran the _Stylus_.
In the spring of 1882 Mr. Van Vechten went into his uncle's bank. The
paper passed into the hands of A. J. Mallahan, and after a little time
was temporarily discontinued. But Mr. Huss gained new courage and
perhaps new capital. September 10, 1882, he started the _Cedar Rapids
People_. It continued as a seven column folio until March, 1884, when
it was bought by Fred Benzinger and R. Baer and its name changed to the
_Saturday Evening Chat_. July 1, 1887, Fred Benzinger bought out Mr.
Baer's interest and ran the paper for a number of years until he went
to Chicago, where for a time he was one of the prominent figures on the
old Chicago _Times-Herald_. Then the paper was acquired by B. R.
Hatmaker, forever famous because of the sobriquet for Cedar Rapids
which flashed into his mind one dreamful day--"The Parlor City."

In 1889 Ernest A. Sherman came to this city and was city editor of the
morning _Republican_ for a while. In February. 1891, he started _Town
Topics_. He ran it until late in the spring of that year and then he
consolidated with Hatmaker's _Saturday Record_. He became the editor,
and Hatmaker was business manager until 1892 when Mr. Sherman bought
the whole business. Since that time the _Record_ has been a permanent
feature in Cedar Rapids, the largest and neatest of the weeklies, being
printed in quarto form on book paper with many illustrations and spicy
comment on "mentionable matters" of Cedar Rapids, with all the local
news well edited.


THE IOWA POST

The _Iowa Post_ was founded in April, 1881, at Iowa City. After passing
through the hands of several owners, it was purchased in March, 1902,
by Henry Gundling of Chicago and brought to this city. Mr. Gundling
changed the paper from a weekly to a semi-weekly and in an incredibly
short time he had trebled the number of his subscribers. Mr. Gundling
had a high school education in Germany, followed by an apprenticeship
there of three years. He had sixteen years experience in Chicago and he
has travelled extensively on three continents. He is, therefore,
thoroughly equipped as an editor and this accounts for the high
standard of his paper which is eagerly read by a very large
constituency in this and adjoining counties and especially at the
colony of Amana.

THE WEST SIDE ENTERPRISE

The _West Side Enterprise_ is one of the latest newspapers in the Linn
county field, having been started December 30, 1909. But it is one of
the liveliest as well as one of the latest. W. I. Endicott is the owner
and publisher, and he is a whole newspaper force in himself. Every
issue of the _Enterprise_ contains something which makes somebody sit
up and take notice. It is a paper devoted to the work of booming the
west side; but it is read on both sides of the river by an ever
increasing number of readers.


IOWA STAATS-ZEITUNG

The _Iowa Staats-Zeitung_ was established in the year 1879 by A. Hunt,
who continued as publisher and editor for many years--until he retired
from the newspaper business. The paper was then bought by John Young
and afterwards sold to the Charles Stoudt Printing Company, who came
from Des Moines to Cedar Rapids to make their home. The company
consists of Charles Stoudt, the publisher, and E. J. Stoudt, editor.
The paper is one of the largest German weeklies in the state,
publishing from twelve to twenty-four pages each issue and going all
over the state. It guarantees to have the largest circulation of any
German paper published in Iowa.


OTHER CEDAR RAPIDS PAPERS

Several other Cedar Rapids newspapers ought to be mentioned. The _Cedar
Rapids Listy_, a Bohemian humorous paper, was established in 1906. Fr.
Hradecky is its editor and publisher. The _Optimus_ is a republican
weekly edited by E. C. Barber, and is a most uncompromising foe of
democracy in all its form. It was established in 1906. The
_Slovan-Ameriky_ is a democratic Bohemian paper, one of the oldest, for
it was established in 1869 and has held the even tenor of its way since
that time through the sunshine and storm of democracy. John B. Letovsky
& Sons are the editors and publishers, and they have been putting out a
good paper week in and week out, year after year.

The _Tribune_ is the organ of the Federation of Labor in Cedar Rapids.
It was started in 1903 and has had a remarkable success. Its first
editor was G. F. Taylor who gave the paper a great start and it is now
edited by R. G. Stewart, who fills its columns full of gingery stuff
week after week and shines best when there is a big political scrap on
hand.


THE MARION REGISTER

In 1852 one A. Hoyt came all the way from New York to blaze the way of
modern journalism on the prairies of Iowa. He established a paper
called the _Prairie Star_. But the _Star_ didn't shine long. Mr. Hoyt
found Iowa so different from old New York. Like the wise men of the
east, after he had let go of most of the treasures he brought with him
he retraced his steps to the east and the paper passed into the hands
of J. H. and G. H. Jennison. They were Whigs with a big W and they
renamed the _Star_ as the _Linn County Register_.

When the republican party was organized, the _Linn County Register_
became one of its most able and enthusiastic advocates in the county.
The late Judge N. M. Hubbard was in active politics at that time and
during that memorable campaign he conducted the _Register_. Ah, "thim
were the days." The judge was a past master in the art of "skinning" an
opponent. That was the method of political fighting in those days and
no editor ever had a sharper knife than Judge Hubbard. He used to say
in later years that it was one of the most enjoyable periods of his
whole life.

"I made the paper grow," he said. "Everybody wanted to get it to see
whose hide was put on the fence that week."

The judge lived to tell the tale, but after the fun was all over and
the battle had been won he decided that railroad law practice was more
profitable than editing a newspaper. The _Register_ passed back into
the editorship of J. H. Jennison. The next year Robert Holmes became
its editor and subsequently its proprietor. He held this position for
five years and it was five years of the most important period in the
history of the county. Mr. Holmes successfully conducted the paper
through the great struggle of the Civil war, and up till 1863 when he
sold it to A. G. Lucas. Its name was then changed to the _Linn County
Patriot_.

In September, 1864, there came from Cedar county, a young
soldier-lawyer, S. W. Rathbun. He purchased the plant and changed the
name of the paper to the _Marion Register_. He has been editor of the
_Register_ ever since that time. He has a few more gray hairs, a few
more wrinkles, and a bit more avoirdupois than he had then, but he
still wields a trenchant pen, still makes the _Register_ a readable and
interesting paper. It has been one of the most influential papers among
the weekly press of Linn county, and has always been firmly republican.


THE MARION SENTINEL

The _Marion Sentinel_ was originally called the _Springville
Independent_, being established at Springville in the year 1879 by Fred
Chamberlain, who afterwards served as county superintendent of the
schools of Linn county. It was a seven-column folio, independent in
politics, the forerunner of the independent papers of the county. It
grew rapidly, and by 1884 had increased to a twelve-page paper. An
edition was also published for Prairieburg, and one for Central City.
In 1885 it had a circulation of 1600. It met with some reverses in 1886
and on July 1 of that year it was moved to Marion and its name changed
to the _Linn County Independent_. Mr. Chamberlain made a big success of
it in Marion. The name of the paper was then changed to the _Marion
Sentinel_. Later O. M. Smith was taken into partnership. The paper then
changed from an independent to a democratic paper, and has remained
democratic until the present time, the only simon pure democratic paper
in Linn county at the present time.

In July, 1891, Mr. Smith sold the paper to Mr. J. J. Galliven, at that
time employed as train dispatcher for the Milwaukee railroad. He
conducted it for less than three months, selling it on September 19,
1891, to its present owner, T. T. Williams. During the greater part of
the time since then C. S. Shanklin, one of the ablest political writers
of the state, has been in charge of the _Sentinel's_ editorial page.
The paper is one of the brightest and newsiest in the county.


THE MT. VERNON HAWKEYE

That splendid Linn county paper, the _Mt. Vernon Hawkeye_, was
established January 1, 1869, by J. T. Rice, as the _Linn County
Hawk-Eye_. Mr. Rice was well known in the early history of the county,
and in late years was a resident of Denver, Colorado, where he died
within the past year.

The _Hawk-Eye_ was bought by S. H. Bauman on June 1, 1869, within five
months after the paper was established, and its name was changed to the
_Mount Vernon Hawk-Eye_. Mr. S. H. Bauman continued the business and
was joined in partnership by his son, A. A. Bauman, January 1, 1892. On
July 1, 1899, S. H. Bauman retired entirely, and the paper was then
conducted by his sons, A. A. and Fred A. Bauman. This partnership was
dissolved November 17, 1909, since which time the paper has been
published by A. A. Bauman.

The paper has always been republican in politics and has never been
shaken by the winds of temporary popular prejudice or passion. It has
had an abiding conviction of political honesty and integrity and it has
been conducted on a high plane. It has rendered good service in the
building up of Mt. Vernon and the county generally.


THE WALKER NEWS

The _Walker News_ was established as a seven-column folio in February,
1883, by David Brant, at present the owner and editor of the Iowa City
_Daily Republican_. He continued as owner and editor for seven years,
and then the paper passed to the hands of Charles A. Durno, Mr. Brant
going to Cedar Rapids to become city editor of the _Gazette_.

In July, 1891, Mr. Durno sold a half interest in the business to C. O.
and J. Barry, who, in January, 1892, acquired the remaining half
interest, Mr. Durno retiring. Mr. Durno was later appointed to a
position in the government printing office at Washington, D. C, and
died in that city a few years ago. The Barrys are still in possession
of the _News_, which is one of the brightest and most influential
newspapers in the county.


THE CENTER POINT JOURNAL

The _Center Point Journal_ is a republican weekly, owned and edited by
J. A. Mahuran, one of the ablest of the Linn county newspaper men. The
paper has had its ups and downs and for a time it was chiefly noted for
its ardent campaign for a fishway in the dam across the Cedar river at
Cedar Rapids. That was during the days of Editor Barber.

The Journal grew out of the _Lotus_ which was started at Center Point,
May 15, 1873, by J. F. Wilson & Co. T. J. Metcalf was its first editor,
and he filled the leaves of the _Lotus_ with spice and sweetness until
1874 when W. T. Baker took charge and subsequently committed suicide.
But that was not the fault of the _Lotus_. The office was then sold to
H. A. Cook, of Cedar Rapids.

In 1876 T. J. Metcalf and S. M. Dunlap purchased the plant and changed
the name of the paper to the _Center Point Mirror_, the first issue
appearing November 18. Then Mr. Metcalf bought out Mr. Dunlap's
interest, and afterwards G. L. Wilson became the owner, changing its
name to the _Courier-Journal_. M. A. Oxley and Charles F. Floyd
afterwards bought the paper and it finally reached the hands of its
present owner.


THE SPRINGVILLE NEW ERA

Springville is one of the best of the Linn county towns and it has one
of the best of the Linn county papers, the Springville _New Era_. Its
first issue appeared August 9, 1882. It was a six-column folio,
independent in politics, and was established by J. B. F. Butler. In
November, 1882, C. S. Shanklin became its editor. At this time it was
changed to a six-column quarto. It became a democratic paper but lately
grew towards independence in politics, a growing tendency among modern
newspapers. There were some more changes of ownership and finally the
paper was purchased by O. E. Crane, its present publisher and editor,
under whom it has risen to a popularity and prosperity never before
attained.


THE LISBON HERALD

Lisbon has one good weekly, the _Herald_. The _Sun_ was the first paper
having been started August 27, 1874, by J. W. Zeigenfus. It was not a
success at the start, or at least it did not bring in the coin of the
realm rapidly enough to suit its proprietor, and he soon sold it to C.
J. Weatherbee. He held it for a few weeks and sold it to W. T. Baker.
Baker managed it admirably for a time but he later shot himself through
the head in his office and for a time the paper was conducted by W. L.
Davis for his widow. Then the Rev. Dewalt S. Fouse became its editor
and did some good work upon it. So did A. M. Floyd, one of the best of
Linn county's newspaper men. But finally the _Sun_ went down.

The _Herald_ has been vigorous and active and prosperous since it was
established in 1894 and it was never so prosperous as now. Under the
able management of Will F. Stahl the paper has grown in size and in
circulation and every issue is filled with up-to-date news and
interesting comment. It is a paper of which Lisbon should be proud.


CENTRAL CITY NEWS-LETTER

Situated in a valley of entrancing beauty, the valley of the Wapsie
river, Central City is one of the most beautiful towns in Iowa and it
certainly is one of the most up-to-date. Much of its growth and its
prestige is due to the fact that for many years it has had a
first-class newspaper. The _Central City News-Letter_, which was
started in 1888, has had a line of able men as its editors and they
have all done their best to make the city grow. None of them ever
worked harder at it than E. S. Weatherbee, who is the owner and the
editor of the paper, the postmaster, the mayor, and an all-around
booster for his town.


THE COGGON MONITOR

Since 1889 Coggon has had a newspaper, the _Coggon Monitor_. It has had
a number of owners, but it is established on a firm basis. Clarence
Cole was the editor until April of this year, when he sold the paper to
William Crosier.


THE MT. VERNON RECORD

In 1893, the _Mount Vernon Record_ was established and it has had a
successful and gratifying growth under the management of Lloyd
McCutcheon, its publisher and editor. Advertising came slowly at
first, as it always does to a new paper, but at present the merchants
of Mt. Vernon are giving it good support. The paper has been
"progressive"--strongly progressive in its editorial policies and
there are many progressives in that neighborhood who have backed it.

CHAPTER XVI

_The Bohemian Element in the County_


It is not the purpose of this history to note in especial manner all
the different nationalities that have entered into the making of our
cosmopolitan population. America is peopled by sturdy men and women who
have come to this land of opportunity and freedom from all the
civilized nations of the world. It is the amalgamation of these
different races and peoples that has done much to give us our sturdy
citizenship. Driven from their old homes by persecutions or the desire
to better their condition, they have come to America and have helped
populate our prairies and develope our cities. They have needed the
opportunities here given them, and we have needed them in our work of
erecting on this continent a nation that shall be an example to all the
nations.

By far the largest and most important element of foreign extraction
represented in Linn county is the Bohemian. Some of our townships are
almost entirely populated by these progressive immigrants and their
descendants, and a goodly percentage of the residents of Cedar Rapids
trace back their Slav ancestry to old Bohemia. These people have always
made good citizens. They possess the desirable faculty of adapting
themselves readily to new environments. Without destroying their own
vigorous vitality, they grasp quickly the best there is in our thought
and mode of life. They have borne nobly their share of the burdens
incident to the establishment of new centers of civilization and of
progress. They have acted their part in our civic life. They have
adapted themselves to and have adopted our institutions. They have
helped and are helping to make the county and the city centers of
growth and prosperity. Trained through the years in habits of economy,
and forced through necessity to keep up these habits, their life here
has often been an incentive to others to go and do likewise. Lovers of
the home, their ambition is to possess their own abiding place, and
that as quickly as possible. The Bohemians are not renters. They are a
class of home owners, and nothing is so potent for stability in any
community as this trait on the part of its people. They are indeed a
thrifty people, such as every state and county and city gladly welcome.
Their buildings, though many of them may be small, are substantial in
their character. The gardens and the grounds surrounding the dwellings
in the towns and cities are neatly kept and attractive to the eye.
Their farms are well tilled and as a result grow rapidly in
productiveness and value.

Our Bohemian citizens bear their part in the administration of public
affairs. And they always make good in the positions in which they are
placed. They have helped make our city councils; they have been men of
ability and of influence on our school boards. They are numbered among
our successful merchants and bankers. Indeed, there is scarce a line of
human endeavor in which they have not been represented by men of
capacity and of worth.

At the request of the editors of this history Joseph Mekota, himself a
splendid representative of a splendid people, contributes the following
sketch of the Bohemian people to this volume:

The history of the Bohemian people in Linn county does not differ
greatly from the general history of this people in our country. Driven
from their native land, on account of political persecution and
official oppression, they sought America as the haven of liberty and
opportunity. They brought with them an abundance of patience, industry,
perseverance, and hope. Their beginning was full of hardships,
privations, and obstacles. Their chief capital was their health and
willingness to toil, and their ability to stand hardship. These were
their native heritage. Coming to this country poor, unacquainted with
its customs, its language, and its laws, their beginning had but few
silver linings.

Despite these inauspicious surroundings these early pioneers were
contented and happy. Physical and material hardships and trials were
cheerfully borne for the joys and sweetness of political and religious
liberty. Under the broad and clear skies of the religious, political,
and intellectual tolerance of America they felt the realization of the
unfulfilled dreams of the glorious but unsuccessful struggles of their
ancestors a century ago. Such a fine spirit towards the highest ideals
in life and civilization, combined with inexhaustible energy and
patience in industrial pursuits, has made this people loyal to our
institutions and useful to the development and progress of our country.

The early settlers came to this county with teams and wagons. At that
time there were no railroads west of the Mississippi river. Many of
them came from Caledonia, Wisconsin, with ox teams. Others came by
railroad as far as the Mississippi river. One member of a family who
came here in 1855 said: "They dumped us out at Muscatine and from there
we hired teams and conveyances to take us to Cedar Rapids. We moved
south of the city and lived under a tree that summer. When we wanted to
buy anything we took a sample of the article in one hand and the amount
of money we wished to expend in the other and would show that to our
neighbors and make them understand what we wanted."

These early settlers devoted themselves to agricultural pursuits. Most
of them located on or near timber lands so that they would have plenty
of fuel. Fuel was very scarce in their native land, and it was easier
to build their sheds if they were in the timber. The prairies at that
time were not desirable for location. A large portion of College
township, which is now the best farming country in the state of Iowa,
at that time was full of marshes, and high grass, and strong winds
prevailed so that the early settlers avoided the prairies and located
in timber districts.

The early Bohemian settlers came to Linn county about the years 1852
and 1853. So far as known, the following families were among the early
pioneers: The Ligr family about the year 1852 settled east of Ely. John
Posler, in the year 1853, also located about eight miles southeast of
the city. In 1854 or earlier, Paul Korab and his family settled about
one mile east of the present town of Western, where also settled at
that time John Witousek. The Korab family came here with an ox team
from the state of Wisconsin by way of Dubuque. That year, 1854, Jacob
Polak located about ten miles southeast of Cedar Rapids, and with him
was Joseph Sosel. These families also came with teams from the state of
Wisconsin. Anton Sulek located in the north part of Johnson county in
1854, and he afterwards lived near Hoosier Grove in this county on a
beautiful, elevated spot called "Hradek," and meaning "Little Castle."
Many other families came in 1855 and settled along the border line
between Johnson and Linn counties, in College and Putnam townships. The
numbers that came were not great, and it was not until after the Civil
war that large numbers of these people came to this county.

Among these people Joseph Sosel was a character of distinction. His
scholarly attainments combined with his love of intellectual and
political freedom easily made him the leader among his people. He was a
political exile. He took an active part in the uprising of Bohemian
students in the year 1848. This movement was for more political rights
and broader freedom for the people in Bohemia. The uprising did not
meet with success, and for his patriotic activity a price was set upon
his head by the Austrian government. With many other students, who
were in the same predicament, he escaped to this country. With him came
Karel Jonas, who afterwards became lieutenant-governor of the state of
Wisconsin; and with them also came Vojtech Naprstek, who left a name in
Bohemian history that is known to every Bohemian.

In this locality Mr. Sosel rendered many valuable services to his
countrymen; being able to talk the English language, he became their
legal and business adviser. He was loyal to his countrymen, and at all
times insisted that they should learn and observe the customs of their
new country. He served faithfully the interests of his people, and his
memory will forever be kindly remembered by them for the many and
useful services which he faithfully rendered.

Up to the time of the Civil war, the Bohemian immigration was slow, but
from those that were here quite a number enlisted from this county to
preserve the integrity of their new country. Among those known who
enlisted were the following: J. F. Bednar, Frank Renchin, Frank
Peremsky, Joseph Wencel, Joseph Podhajsky, John Maly, Joseph Zahradnik,
Charles Bednar, Joseph Horak, Wesley Horak, Frank Dolezal, Joseph
Dolezal.

After the Civil war Cedar Rapids became a prominent center of Bohemian
population. Many came direct from their own country, others came from
neighboring states, and still others came from the surrounding country
in this state. So that at all times this city always had a large
percentage of people of Bohemian origin, larger than any other city of
its size in the state of Iowa. In the county they settled in Putnam,
College and Franklin townships. From the year 1866, after the Prussian
war in Austria, to 1880 were perhaps the banner years of Bohemian
emigration to this country. These people all located in the city or
southeast of the city. There are today in Cedar Rapids about 8,500
inhabitants of this nationality and about 2,500 more in other parts of
the county. They are now scattered all over the county, but large and
heavy settlements are in Putnam and College townships, these being
almost exclusively settled by Bohemians. There is a large settlement in
Fairfax township, and there are settlements in Franklin, Bertram,
Boulder, and Grant townships.

In agriculture they are successful farmers. No better improved farms,
no better buildings, no better systems of farming exist in any other
part of the state than in the communities settled by these people. They
are progressive and up to date in all matters. They are hard working
people and devoted to the interests of their farms.

In Cedar Rapids they have also played an important part. A large
majority came to this country very lightly endowed with worldly goods,
but they were strong in health and body and not afraid to work. A very
large percentage of these people belong to the laboring class. The
women in the families worked as hard, if not harder, than the men. The
first ambition of these people after their arrival in this country was
to own a home. The father would work, the mother would work, and the
children would work in order to buy and pay for a home. A great many of
them bought vacant lots and improved them by erecting neat and
comfortable dwellings. At times it was claimed they took their children
out of school too early in order that they might work. In the early
times there existed circumstances which could not very well avoid this
situation. The wages were low; families as a rule were large and in
order to pay for a home and in order that the debts be paid, and to
meet expenses, it was necessary in many cases to press the children
into service. This custom became somewhat contagious among the men,
women, and children. One family was bound to earn and make as much
money as its neighbors, and therefore had to have as many members of
the family working. It is a source of congratulation that this custom,
which had been one of necessity, is now losing ground among the ranks
of this nationality and their children are kept in school as long as
any children among other American people.

The Bohemian people from the very first held tenaciously to their
mother tongue. While they were loyal to our public schools and other
institutions, they took steps to preserve and cultivate the mother
tongue among themselves and their children. As early as 1868 a society
called the "Reading Society" was organized. The purpose of this society
was to cultivate the Bohemian language; give aid to Bohemian schools;
furnish the best books of Bohemian literature to the people of our
city, and in every way possible to promote and awaken the love for
Bohemian language and history among the people. It was a center of
national life and spirit. In this laudable purpose the Reading Society
of Cedar Rapids has met with unparalleled success.

The society today owns a fine library of nearly 3,000 volumes of the
best works of history, art, and literature in the Bohemian tongue.
Besides this, the Reading Society has always been helpful, and largely
instrumental in starting, promoting, and encouraging other
organizations of national character.

The Bohemian people are fond of the theatre and theatrical
performances. At about the time that the Reading Society was organized,
they started an association for the purpose of giving theatrical
performances in the Bohemian tongue. The plays given were popular and
successful, and on many occasions there was displayed splendid
histrionic talent among the members of this dramatic club. Their
performances were always clean, instructive, and educational. Today we
have in Cedar Rapids two large dramatic associations whose performances
are a credit to our city and its people.

In the matter of education, the Bohemian people always took an active
part. Besides having their children attend the public schools, they
took opportunity to have them taught in the Bohemian language during
their vacations and sometimes on Sundays. This was so from their
earliest settlement. At first one or two rooms in a public school
building were used. Later on a building costing over $8000.00 was
erected for this purpose. The building stands on the corner of Second
street and Tenth avenue. This building has the honored distinction of
being the only building in our whole country built and used exclusively
as a Bohemian school.

Another institution that has brought fame and favor to our city in
educational circles, is the Council of Higher Education. This was
founded here in 1902. It is an organization whose object it is to
furnish honor loans without interest to poor but promising boys and
girls of Bohemian origin to secure a college education. Since its
organization this institution has aided many young men and women who
were without sufficient means to secure a college education. Last year
it had sixteen students it was aiding in the various state universities
and colleges. Its operation is nation wide. It has students in New
York, Michigan, Illinois, Texas, Nebraska, and Iowa. The funds of the
institution are gathered by popular subscriptions among individuals and
societies. Its scope covers every state in the Union where there is a
Bohemian settlement. The institution has achieved wonders in
encouraging young men and women of Bohemian nationality to attend
universities and colleges.

In musical circles the Bohemian people have distinguished themselves
from early times. In the beginning when the Bohemian settlers came to
this city they organized a musical society. This formed a nucleus for
one of the most famous musical bands in the state. Kouba's National
Band achieved state wide reputation; this band has always been composed
of a large percentage of Bohemian musicians.

In the material development of Cedar Rapids the Bohemian people have
done their full share. In the ranks of labor they are known as honest,
industrious, peaceable, and orderly. They are very largely employed in
all the big industrial institutions of our city. They command the
confidence and respect of their employers. This nationality is also
well represented in every line of business in our city. All the
professions are represented. When we consider that less than two
generations ago their ancestors came here with bare hands and not
knowing the English language and unacquainted with the customs and
without any particular advantages, except those of honesty and
willingness to work, it is remarkable that such strides forward have
been made by this nationality in the realms of labor, business, and the
professions.

In religious work the Bohemian people of Linn county have accomplished
splendid results. With the first settlers in this county, the Catholics
of this city had a place of worship. From its modest beginning there
grew one of the largest congregations in the city. And what
enthusiastic and untiring workers this church has! The congregation
consists very largely of the laboring class, but they have accomplished
wonderful results. A splendid church building; a large parochial
school; an assembly hall and a new parsonage are the reward of the
patience and perseverance among the members of this congregation. St.
Wenceslaus church of Cedar Rapids with its manifold work and influence
is a great honor to the people of Linn county.

Way back in the late sixties, on a beautiful and secluded spot on
Hoosier Creek, about one-half the distance between the present site of
Ely and Western, there was erected a small church of the Reformed
Evangelical denomination. There a band of devout men and women met to
worship in the simple manner of the Moravian brothers. Their leader and
minister was a man of grace, of purity of character and rare and
scholarly attainments. His name was Frank Kun. He was a great preacher
and a great teacher. For a time he held the chair of Greek and Latin at
Western College, but as his congregation increased he devoted all his
time to his people. His congregation was entirely of the rural class.
He loved his people and in turn was loved by them. His congregation was
one of the best Bohemian congregations in the United States; his
sermons were masterpieces of art and beauty, full of religious fervor,
stately dignity and depth. His memory will forever be revered by the
people of Linn county. This church is still there; broadening its
sphere of work it now has two branches, one in Johnson county, and one
in Linn county, the last being the old Baptist church in Putnam
township.

In Cedar Rapids the Bohemian people have three protestant churches: the
Fourth Presbyterian, the Bohemian Methodist, and the Reformed church;
all three are prosperous. All of them have large and substantial
memberships and all of them are fortunate in having strong, capable,
and popular men as ministers. Under the wise and liberal policies of
these leaders these churches are doing excellent work among the
Bohemian people.

There is a large, respectable element of the Bohemian population that
does not belong to any church organization. They are not opposed to
churches, nor to religion, but do not affiliate with any church
organization. They believe that every one should be permitted to think
and believe as he pleases in matters of faith. In the Bohemian language
they are called "Svobodamysli." This word does not mean Free Thinkers.
"This Bohemian word is made up of two words 'Liberty' and 'Mind,' and
it means the broadest toleration for the religious beliefs and opinions
of others; and further it means that you should give the widest
latitude to the religious beliefs and forms of worship of your
neighbors, and that they should do the same to you; and it further
means that you should honor and respect the religious views and
professions of your neighbors and they should do the same by you."

No sketch of the Bohemian people in Cedar Rapids and Linn county would
be complete without referring to the Sokols. This is a society whose
purpose is physical culture. The society is well represented in Cedar
Rapids, and has among its members some of the best all around athletes
in this country. In 1909 a team of six men of this organization
captured the first prize at the National Contest in New York city of
the Bohemian Sokols Society in the United States. The society owns a
fine building and gymnasium here. It is an old organization, dating
back to about the time when the Reading Society was organized, at that
time being a branch fostered by the Reading Society. The society has
several instructors of physical culture and gives to boys and girls,
and young men and young women, a thorough course in gymnastics.

The Bohemian people of this city are thoroughly and actively interested
in the principle of modern fraternalism. Among this element the
fraternal orders and societies find much favor and popularity. There
are very few men and women of this nationality who do not belong to at
least one fraternal order, and there are many who belong to a half
dozen fraternal orders. In fact the Bohemian element in the city of
Cedar Rapids is honey-combed with lodges, orders, and societies of
fraternal character. The Reading Society, already mentioned, was the
nucleus, from which, as time went on, manifold ramifications sprang,
finally developing into an extraordinary number of fraternal societies
and lodges.

At first these societies were more of a national spirit and character,
but later the insurance feature became an important part. The Bohemian
people have great faith in fraternal insurance. The next thing after a
home is acquired, fraternal insurance is provided. Some of the
societies are exclusively for men, and some are exclusively for women,
but the tendency of the last ten years is to permit both sexes to
become members of the same lodge. This too has its advantages, and if
fraternal orders are to be more than mere insurance companies, a
greater diversity of membership, greater benefits and advantages will
flow from them. All the orders and lodges are in a prosperous
condition. Three fine and capacious halls have been built and there is
need and place for them all.

The C. S. P. S. hall was built in 1891, the Z. C. B. J. hall was built
in 1908, and the Sokol hall in 1908. There is a Bohemian hall in Ely,
Iowa. The Z. C. B. J. is a large and flourishing fraternal order whose
supreme lodge has been located in Cedar Rapids since its organization
in 1897. This in English is called the Western Bohemian Fraternal
Association, and it is doing business in ten or twelve states in the
Union.

In 1885 there was an Odd Fellows lodge instituted, whose members are
all Bohemians, and whose rituals and work are in the Bohemian language.
This lodge has the distinction of being the only Bohemian Odd Fellows
lodge west of the Mississippi river. The spirit of fraternalism has had
a remarkably good influence upon the character and intelligence of the
Bohemian people. The financial benefits to the widows and children
flowing from these societies may be great, but the moral, intellectual,
and educational benefits to the members are immeasurably greater.

In the United States there are many Bohemian communities and
settlements. In some of the eastern cities the settlements are very
large, for instance in Chicago there are 100,000 Bohemians; in New York
about 40,000; in Cleveland about 40,000; and there are very large
settlements throughout Minnesota, the two Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas,
and Texas.

In intelligence and educational advancement, in the broad scope and
high ideals of modern fraternalism, in social progress and in business
and industrial enterprise, and in the professions, the Bohemian people
of Linn county and Cedar Rapids rank foremost among all the Bohemian
communities in the United States. This is a recognized fact among other
Bohemian communities and cities in our country. We are proud of the
fact that our city has won the beautiful title of "Parlor City," but
more proud should we be of the fact that in all the Bohemian
communities and large centers of Bohemian population from New York to
California, Cedar Rapids is known as "The Bohemian Athens of America."




CHAPTER XVII

_The Early Marriage Record_


An interesting book in the office of the county clerk at Marion is the
first marriage record kept in the county. Through the courtesy of
County Clerk William Dennis we are enabled to give below a record of
marriages that took place in the county from 1841 to 1855. The names
and the dates have been transcribed with care, though it is possible
some names here printed are not correct in every particular, due to the
inability to read the writing in the record. As a rule the penmanship
of our early clerks was distinct and readable. This is true in especial
manner of the incumbency of Hosea W. Gray, who was clerk during most of
the years covered by this transcript.

The book consulted in the preparation of this chapter contains both the
licenses granted and the returns of the marriages. In a few instances
the names in the licenses are different from those given in the
returns.

A thing to be noted in this early marriage record is the youth of many
of the parties. In many instances the records show the marriage of
young girls of 15 and 16 years.

A number of licenses are recorded, but there is no evidence in the book
that the marriages were ever celebrated, due doubtless to the failure
of the officiating clergyman or justice to make the proper returns.

Many names familiar in the early days appear in this record. And it is
valuable not only because it lists those pioneers who here set up their
household gods soon after they arrived in the county, but also because
it gives the names of the early ministers and justices of the peace in
Linn county.

In this record book are recorded the licenses of the ministers of the
gospel who were authorized to perform the marriage ceremony. Here are
some of the names, many of them doubtless familiar to the survivors of
that time:

Reverends John Hodges, Michael Summer, John Stocker, William C. Rankin,
Israel C. Clark, F. R. S. Byrd, James L. Thompson, Warren B. Morey,
Salmon Cowles, Isaac Searles, Henry Reed, Christian Troup, John
Hindman, Allen Johnson, Uriah Ferree, James M. Fanning, Peter Robinson,

CHAPTER XVIII

_Historic Roads and Other Monuments_


In the early days it was essential to establish means of communication
between points. Where there were no navigable rivers the legislatures,
and even congress, passed certain acts establishing roads. The
Territorial legislature which met in Burlington in 1838 and 1839 among
many other road laws approved the following passed January 25, 1839:

     "That Isaac [Israel] Mitchell, of Linn county, Iowa, John G.
     Fay, of Cedar county, and Jonathan Pettibone, of Muscatine
     county, be and are hereby appointed commissioners to lay out
     a road commencing at Bloomington, Muscatine county, thence to
     Rochester and Cedar county and thence to the county seat of
     Linn county. That said commissioners, or a majority of them,
     shall meet at Burlington on the first Monday of May next to
     discharge their duties."--Section 3, p. 461, Laws of Iowa.

     "It is further enacted that Alfred Carter, Warren Stiles and
     A. F. Russell, of Scott county, be and are hereby appointed
     commissioners to lay out a territorial road commencing at
     Davenport, Scott county, thence to Hickory Grove, thence to
     Poston's Grove, thence to Red Oak Grove, thence to Pioneer
     Grove, thence to Big Linn Grove, thence to the seat of
     justice of Linn county, said commissioners to meet, or a
     majority of them, to discharge their duties at Davenport on
     the first Monday of May next."--Section 8, p. 462, Laws of
     Iowa.

A number of these laws were passed laying out what were known as
"territorial and state roads." For example, there was the well known
Dubuque-Iowa City road passing through Anamosa, Springville, and Mount
Vernon. Then there were the two well known roads passing through
Marion, one known as the Toledo road running nearly directly west of
Cedar Rapids to Toledo, and a road much travelled in the early day; the
other road branched from the Toledo road about four miles west of the
city and was an angling road known in this county as the Marengo road,
the State road, as well as the Des Moines road, which also was laid out
over high ground in nearly a straight angling line to Marengo, and then
west through Brooklyn, Grinnell, and Newton to Des Moines. This road
was used much by the forty-niners crossing the state for the gold
fields of California, and now and then some farmer has picked out of
his field where the old road has been changed little horse shoes, shoes
used for oxen, hammers and hatchets, and other utensils which had been
left or lost by the early gold seekers.

There were two roads between Cedar Rapids and Marion well known in the
early days, one called the old Marion road and the other running about
where the street railway now runs.

Another road which was much used in the early days was known as the
Cedar Rapids and Center Point road. It was much travelled by all people
from the north part of the county.

Another road was the Marion-Mt. Vernon road, as well as the Western
road, and the Mt. Vernon-Ivanhoe Bridge road leading to Iowa City.

The Code of 1851, referring to the State roads, directs that these
roads shall be maintained by the respective counties but that such
State roads shall not be discontinued or diminished in size.--Sections
557, 558, Code of Iowa, 1851.

At this time roads were under the supervision of the county court.
Later they came under the supervision of the county supervisors.

For many years it was believed that a certain hill overgrown by trees
near the Milwaukee tracks in the edge of Kenwood had been a
fortification erected by the United States government in the early days
for defending the settlers from Indian attacks.

A school house was later erected on or near this locality and was known
as "Ft. George School House." Many of the old settlers remembered this
locality and called it the old fort. An investigation was made and the
following letter written by Samuel W. Durham explains itself:

     "The house was built by a man by the name of George, of
     German descent, and afterwards bought and occupied by
     Ambrose Harland who gave the little irregular tract and
     house the name of Ft. George in honor of its first owner and
     its having the appearance of being constructed to resist,
     not Indians, but cold winds as they swept up Indian creek.
     Harland was a character, born in Kentucky, removed to
     Crawfordsville, Indiana, and was the sheriff of that county.
     This was the home of Lew Wallace, the author of Ben Hur, and
     also the home of Henry S. Lane who first named Abraham
     Lincoln as president in a convention in Chicago in 1860.
     Harland moved to Linn county succeeding Hosea W. Gray as
     sheriff, and was succeeded by me in that office. He was a
     six-footer and large and would fight, but once fell heavily
     before Perry Oxley's huge fist."

The person who erected the house which appeared like a fort was no
other than George Hesing, who owned the land and was a peculiar
character in his day. He did plant cottonwood trees around the house
and also scraped up dirt so as to keep out the wind and snows as much
as possible from his yard. In a few years the trees grew up and the
rubbish accumulated, and they gave the place the appearance and made it
look like an old abandoned fortification. It is said that a certain Mr.
Willard having charge of the erection of a school house near this
location named it the "Ft. George School House," which name it bore as
long as it stood there.

A number of plats have been filed in the recorder's office at Marion,
and these have again been transcripted for public use, but before towns
could be platted a number of towns were staked out before the land was
laid out and surveyed by the government; of these plats we have no
record. The first plat was, no doubt, that of Westport, located on the
banks of the Cedar river and near Bertram. This was staked out by
Israel Mitchell July 4, 1838. Ivanhoe was laid out some distance below
at the present Ivanhoe bridge in the same year. Another town was staked
out by J. Wilbert Stone along the Cedar river at the lower rapids
within the corporate limits of the present Cedar Rapids. There is no
record of any plat of this town. In 1844 Westport was again platted as
Newark by James M. Doty. This is the first recorded plat and seems to
have been filed November 21, 1844, by John Zinbar, recorder. (See Vol.
A, p. 301, Lands.) This is now a corn field and has long since been
vacated.

New Linden was another town platted in the early days; this plat was
filed by P. S. Embree, surveyor, April 15, 1853, being property owned
by A. E. Simpson and A. P. Risley and located on sections 27 and 28,
township 84, range 5, Brown township. This, also, now is nothing but a
corn field.

Another was the plat of New Buffalo in the town of New Buffalo which is
filed in Vol. 4, p. 217, of the Land Records of Linn county; this has
also been vacated.

The plat of the town of Mayfield was made by J. M. May and filed for
record in Vol. 143, p. 624. It bordered on the Cedar river and embraced
lot 4 and part of section 34, township 83, range 7. It also has been
abandoned, although May's twenty-five additions, re-plats, etc., made
by Major May, are still parts of additions to Cedar Rapids. Major May
was a man of enthusiasm, and speculated, believing, with Colonel
Sellers, that in every enterprise he undertook there would be millions,
but he died a poor, unknown and disappointed man.

Many of the old town sites have been vacated, and many of the old
postoffices and country stores which one found throughout the county in
the early fifties can no longer be found on the map. From _Iowa as It
Is_, published in 1855, at page 153 we find the following notices
concerning Linn county towns and postoffices: Spring Grove, Boulder,
Central Point, Cedar Oak, Newark, St. Julien, Ivanhoe, and Hoosier
Grove, besides such towns as Cedar Rapids, Palo, Marion, and Mount
Vernon. The book also mentions Iowa Conference Seminary, with a three
story building, and with Rev. S. N. Fellows as superintendent.

N. H. Parker in his _Handbook of Iowa_, issued in 1856, mentions a few
more new towns not mentioned in the previous list, as follows: Fairfax,
Lisbon, Lafayette, Mon Diu, Necot, Oak Grove, Prospect Hill, St. Mary,
Springville, and Valley Farm. This author also speaks of the newspapers
published in the county, the _Register_ at Marion, and the _Times_, the
_Farmer_, and the _Democrat_ at Cedar Rapids.

Another handbook of the state, published by J. G. Mills, of New York,
in 1857, mentions the towns set out in the handbook of a year previous
and adds the new town of much promise by the high-toned name of Paris,
located in Jackson township, near the present town of Coggon.

Few, if any, today can locate those villages and towns which sprang up
from time to time over the county, and which long since have passed out
of history and memory.

Of the newspapers published at that time only the Marion _Register_ has
continued to be issued. The others have passed away and one does not
now know who were the editors and publishers of these early attempts at
journalism in the pioneer days. These newspapers, no doubt, did much in
keeping open the spirit of the people and in advertising the state.

CHAPTER XIX

_Some of the Old Settlers_


It is, perhaps, impossible to say even now with any degree of
certainty, who was the first actual settler in Linn county. However, it
is not very difficult to mention at least some of the early settlers.
It is said that Dyer Usher and James Ames came up the Cedar river as
far as the rapids on a hunting expedition as early as the spring of
1836; how long these men remained in what later became Linn county is
not known, but it is not likely that they stayed very long. We have
pretty good evidence that later during the summer came Daniel C. Doty,
his two sons, James, and Elias, and nephew, Jacob Crane, as far as
Bertram and viewed the country expecting to locate when land was thrown
open for settlement. Mr. Doty was born in Essex county, New Jersey, in
1764, had early drifted west to Cincinnati, and by boat had come down
the Ohio and up the Mississippi, landing at what is now Muscatine. His
children were born in Ohio. They followed the Cedar river until they
struck what became later Linn county to locate claims. There were no
settlers here, and they found no people with whom to converse, but
figured that here would be a good location to get cheap land when this
land was opened for settlement. They returned to Ohio for their
families, expecting to return the following spring, but they did not,
in fact, return for three years on account of the financial depression.
Israel Mitchell staked out the town first called Westport in July,
1838, which town was later called Newark, named in honor of Newark, New
Jersey, where the family originally came from. Here Elias Doty, Jr.,
was born in October, 1841. Elias Doty, Sr., erected the first sawmill
on Big creek in 1841, in the erection of which mill he was killed in
the raising of the timbers. Daniel Doty, Sr., had the following sons,
to-wit: James, Elias, John, and Daniel, all young men who early drifted
west. Daniel C. Doty, the father of these sons, was never a resident of
this county, but simply came here to find homes for his children. He
died in Ohio in 1849; the widow died in Ohio in 1863 at the advanced
age of ninety-eight.

James Doty, born in 1809, was the first real pottery maker in Iowa. He
had learned the trade in Ohio. This crude pottery building was standing
on the old homestead up to within a few years ago. At the time of his
death, January 17, 1847, he had over three hundred jars, jugs, crocks,
etc., ready for delivery. In this early day there was great demand for
such merchandise as it was something every farmer had to have, and it
could only be obtained in a few places and at high prices on account of
the transportation.

Another Linn county pioneer well known in the early days was Israel
Mitchell, who staked out the town of Westport in 1838. Mr. Mitchell was
born in Kentucky, January 15, 1796, the son of Moses Mitchell, of
Scotch descent, and on the mother's side, Elizabeth Grant, of Welsh
descent, and a near relative of Daniel Boone, the Indian fighter. As a
young man Israel Mitchell attended a Kentucky college and graduated
therefrom. He studied for the ministry, but gave that up on account of
his voice, and later took a course in medicine, but gave up the
practice, as his step-daughter, Mrs. Slavin, writes, "because he was
too tender hearted." He had studied law as well as surveying. After his
marriage he removed to Ohio in the early '20s with his wife and two
children, viz: Angeline and John Mitchell. He soon drifted into
Indiana, and from there he removed to Wisconsin, working in the lead
mines near Apple river in the southwest part of the state as surveyor.
From Wisconsin he came by way of Dubuque to Linn county in the spring
of 1838 in company with John, James, and Chamber Hunter, and Jacob
Leabo. They all settled on the banks of the Cedar river in sections 32
and 33, township 83, range 6. Mr. Mitchell was a widower at this time
and he and his children stayed with the Leabo family. At Marion he
married Mrs. Mary Ross, nee Mary Arnold, a native of Princeton, New
Jersey, on November 7, 1845, Esquire Goudy, one of the first justices
of the peace, performing the marriage ceremony according to the
territorial laws of Iowa. Of this marriage were born five children:
Luther H., Caroline, Israel, Boone, and Maris Morton. By her first
marriage Mrs. Ross had four children. She died in Oregon in 1858.

Mr. Mitchell sat on the first grand jury summoned in the county, was
one of the first justices of the peace in the county, and was also the
first probate judge. He acted as a frontier lawyer, did more or less
surveying, at which he was an expert, and in many ways was a most
useful man to the community. Mr. Mitchell was a true southerner, his
home was always open, and he did much entertaining. He spent much of
his time interesting his friends and acquaintances in new enterprises,
and in various ways tried to build up a great town on the banks of the
Cedar river. Whether it was due to the failure of his new town to
materialize or the western fever that got hold of him, we do not know,
but just at a time when he should have remained he saw fit to emigrate,
going with oxen overland with his family in 1847, locating about eight
miles southwest of Portland, Oregon. Here he tilled the soil and became
a noted surveyor. In 1873 he returned to Linn county to visit his old
friends, giving glowing descriptions of the far west and especially of
the Spokane country. On his return by way of San Francisco to Portland
he fell in one of the gangways on the steamer, and received injuries
from which he died a few days later after reaching home. Mr. Mitchell
was a member of the Presbyterian church and affiliated with the
democratic party. J. J. Daniels, his old friend, described Judge
Mitchell as follows: "He was truly an educated man, and in early life
had learned the science of surveying, and this was the work he was
particularly called for; when not engaged in this occupation he farmed
and kept a ferry. When the writer became acquainted with him on the
Cedar river he was an active man on foot and could swim almost equal to
a duck; bathing in the Cedar in warm weather was his usual custom. He
was a medium sized man and stood very straight and erect, having black
hair a little tinged with grey, large blue eyes, a high, round
forehead, and in appearance resembled Edgar A. Poe, and was equally as
brilliant a poet as Poe, having enough manuscript to make a book of
poems. He was truly a Christian man in many acts of kindness, and
verified his profession of faith in a true Christian religion."

Robert Ellis, Linn county's oldest living settler, was born in
Westmoreland, county, Pennsylvania, January 20, 1817, emigrated to Ohio
in 1837, later to Michigan, and started on foot to Iowa Territory in
the winter of 1838. He remained for a few weeks in Cedar county and
started again on foot looking for a claim in the timber near some
river. Coming to the present site of Cedar Rapids the first man he
found was a man by the name of Hull, who held down a claim where the T.
M. Sinclair Company packing house is now located; coming further up
along the river he found the tavern of Osgood Shepherd. Mr. Ellis liked
the place and staked out his claim on his present location near what is
known as Ellis Park. He was at work there cutting wood one day when
Shepherd came along with another man, and insisted that this claim
belonged to him. Ellis was not easily frightened, and as Shepherd was
going to attack him, Ellis raised his ax and threatened to chop his
head in two if he took another step. This threatening attitude on the
part of Ellis frightened Shepherd and he and his companion retreated,
Ellis never being disturbed afterwards. Shepherd never referred to the
matter. The next summer when Shepherd's father died Ellis and
Lichtebarger made the coffin and assisted at the burial, when Shepherd
seemed to be very much touched by the kindness of these two men and
thanked them profusely.

Ellis became a friend of the Lichtebarger boys and also of O. S.
Bolling. Bolling and Ellis assisted Tom Lewis, the old pioneer, to get
his wagon and cattle across the river when he came west to locate, on
what became later known as "Lewis Bottoms." Ellis worked for awhile at
the Winnebago Mission at Ft. Atkinson, Iowa, where he met a number of
military men who later became known in the Mexican war, as well as in
the Civil war.

As he was frequently in company with men who took newspapers and who
had travelled about the country, he heard of the gold excitement in
California and at once crossed the country to Marion wanting to go
west. At Marion he met Dan Mentzer, a man by the name of Harvey, and
another person by the name of Green. They purchased an outfit and
started for California in April, 1849, arriving at the diggings in that
state the same summer after many hard experiences. He remained for
several years digging gold as a placer miner and keeping a grocery
store, and for a time he ran a stage between Georgetown and Coloma,
earning express, passengers, and the mail. Here he met and associated
with Sutter, the old German who discovered the first gold diggings, as
well as his partner, saw Fair, Huntington, Mackey, and the boisterous
Stewart, some of them "running saloons today and owning mines
tomorrow." After remaining in California for seven years he returned
home by way of the Nicaragua route and there met and talked with
General Walker, the famous filibusterer.

Philip Hull, according to Robert Ellis, had arrived in what became
Cedar Rapids just a very few weeks before he came. He says: "Hull was
of my age and I took a liking to him. He weighed about 170 pounds, was
about five feet eight inches tall, had dark hair and was stoop
shouldered. He was a native of Ohio, and returned to Illinois or Ohio
in 1840 to get married, as he was very lonesome out here on the
prairies of Iowa. Hull never returned to Cedar Rapids. Mr. Hull and I
walked to William Abbe's and bought four yoke of oxen, a wagon, and a
breaking plow. We had but little money so we agreed that in payment for
this property we should break 75 acres of land and cut and split 10,000
rails, which we did. It took two men to break, one to handle the cattle
and one to hold the plow. It was no easy job on a hot day when the oxen
would pull for a pond with all their might if not closely watched, and
many were the times they would give us the slip and would lie down in
the pond and we could do nothing but wait till the air cooled and night
came on. Neither one of us made anything, and I saw nothing of Mr. Hull
till I met him at Sacramento, California, where he had preceded me by
several months. We often talked over our lives in Linn county, neither
one at the time even believing that Cedar Rapids had any future. Hull
was an agreeable companion, a splendid fellow and square in all his
dealings. He preferred frontier life and would be content in no other
locality except on the frontier."

Ellis says further of Wm. Abbe:

     "Abbe and I were in partnership in dealing with the
     government. Abbe made the deals with the government and I
     made most of the purchases from the settlers. At one time
     Abbe and I had just completed a contract with the government
     for provisions, and then Indian Agent Harvey in St. Louis
     insisted that we must also furnish 100 cattle within six
     days at Ft. Atkinson. This was rather a difficult task but
     Abbe said we had to do it and we rode away in a hurry back
     home to buy up cattle and drive them back to be there in
     time. We worked day and night and had the cattle at Ft.
     Atkinson on time. As Abbe had to go to Prairie du Chien I
     was ordered to return home with $1,000.00 in gold which had
     been paid for the cattle. I did not like to go alone over
     the open prairie with the money but there was no way out of
     it and so I started bright and early. That night I reached
     Quasqueton and stayed over night at a small tavern where
     there were all kinds of people hanging about. The next day I
     set out again and got down in the neighborhood of Center
     Point and there spied a deer. I got off my horse and loaded
     my gun, aimed, and fired. The horse shied and off it started
     on a dead run with the gold in the saddle bags. I next
     wanted to shoot the horse for it was worth much less than
     the money, but before I could reload the horse was out of
     range. I ran as fast as I could and in an hour found the
     horse tied to a tree in the timber with the gold safe in the
     saddle bags."

Asked how about the deer, Mr. Ellis replied, "Well, I never took time
to see whether I killed that deer or not. I was so excited about that
gold and that horse that I forgot the deer at that time and never
turned around to look."

Since his return home Mr. Ellis has lived quietly on his claim, which
now for the most part has been platted into city lots. Mr. Ellis is the
only person now living who can remember when he saw one cabin here
become a city of 34,000 inhabitants.

John J. Daniels, the son of Jeremiah Daniels, came to Bertram township
in the spring of 1844, his father entering land on what is known as
Indian creek, erecting a log house and barn thereon. J. J. Daniels was
one of the first school teachers in the county. He held many township
offices, and was for a time county recorder. Jerry Daniels died in
1882, and John J. Daniels a short time ago.

James Bassitt and wife came to Linn county in March, 1839, and Mrs.
Bassitt is supposed to have been the first white woman to cross Indian
creek, a stream which empties into the Cedar river below Cedar Rapids.
A short time afterwards Rufus H. and Sarah Ann Lucore came from
Pennsylvania and stopped with the Bassitts. On the first day of April,
1839, arrived Joseph H. and John Lichtebarger, locating on what became
Kingston or West Cedar Rapids; later a brother, Isaac, also arrived.
These brothers erected one of the first cabins, in May of that year, on
the west side of the river. It is still standing.

At what became Central City arrived in August, 1839, Joseph Clark and
family; this place was for a long time known as Clark's Ford. Here Mr.
Clark erected a primitive grist mill by selecting a hollow gum and
placing in the trunk of the tree a stone; upon this was placed another
stone which was operated by a long sweep and turned on a pivot; in this
rude manner enough meal was ground out to supply the family.

Joel and James Leverich arrived in this county some time in 1839, and
chose for their home what became later known as "Mound Farm." Ira
Leverich jumped a claim which had been staked out in April of this year
by Rufus Lucore and after more or less trouble, in which the settlers
took Lucore's part, Leverich had to yield and give up his pretended
right. Joel was a noted character. He is described as a man of
commanding presence. For a number of years he controlled the elections
and it was told that "as Joel Leverich went so went Linn county." Dr.
S. D. Carpenter, who arrived in 1849, has the following to say about
Joel Leverich: "I had hardly got settled until I was interviewed by old
Joel Leverich, the noted character of Linn county of that day. He was
known as the 'bogus coon' because, as was alleged, he had to do with
counterfeiters. He was a power in politics and was the kind of a man
from which the modern boss has evoluted. Joel looked me over, asked
where I was from, where I was going, and what my business was, etc. I
was somewhat indignant and tried to be sarcastic, but Joel in
terminating his interview with me squelched me by remarking, 'Young
man, a fellow who wears such a hat as you may pass in this country, but
I consider it d--d doubtful.' I, unfortunately, wore a black plug hat
which was not the style in Iowa at that time. In after years Joe and I
became fast friends and I became quite convinced that the shady stories
told of him were the talk of enemies who were jealous of him because he
was smarter than the greater majority of them. I was with him when he
died and although he was a free thinker he passed away with all the
calmness of a stoic philosopher." When on his death bed some one said
to Leverich, "Joe, you have burned the candle at both ends." "Yes," he
replied, "and now it burns me in the middle."

George R. Carroll in his _Pioneer History_, speaking of Leverich, says:
"The Mound Farm did not remain long in the possession of Broady,
possibly a year and a half, when it came into possession of the
notorious Joel Leverich; everybody knew him and everybody dreaded him,
especially when he was under the influence of liquor, which was often
the case. Even his best friends then felt it to be prudent to give him
a wide berth, not knowing what instant he would take it into his head
to knock them down. Whiskey seemed to make a demon of him, and to
attempt to reason with him while under its influence would have been as
futile as to try to reason with a cyclone. His poor wife, a most
patient and estimable Christian woman, would sometimes hide away from
him for days lest in his fits of uncontrol and uncontrollable passion
he might take her life. And yet old Joe, as he was popularly called,
had a good deal of influence in the community. He was a strong partisan
politician, and whoever arrayed himself against him was sure to have a
hard battle to fight and in the end would very likely meet with defeat.
He was as keen and cunning and wily as the old serpent himself, and it
was very hard to circumvent him in his plans. He was accused of
harboring horse thieves and of making counterfeit money; as to whether
he ever did either or not I could not say."

While T. S. Parvin was United States attorney at Muscatine Joel
Leverich was tried for counterfeiting, and while Parvin had said some
hard things about Joel's mode of making a living he had also said some
very nice things about Joel's wife. Later Leverich called on Parvin at
the hotel, insisting upon speaking with him. Parvin's friends warned
him not to do so as Joe would likely kill him, but Mr. Parvin thought
he would take his chance and Joe did see him. Leverich said, "Ain't you
afraid of me?" "No," replied Parvin, "you can kill me if you want to
but you cannot scare me." "Well," replied Joe, "I admire your grit; I
came not to scare you or to hurt you but to tell you that you did tell
the truth about my wife." Some time after that Parvin passed where
Leverich lived and accepted of Mr. Leverich's hospitality.

Joel Leverich's brother, James, was a saloonkeeper in Cedar Rapids and
when he ascertained that Joel's death was due to his dissipation,
causing a serious stomach trouble, he quit the business. Joel Leverich
sold his claim in 1843 to Judge Greene. He resided near the McCloud Run
for a short time and then moved to town, dying in the '40s.

One of the most unique characters in Cedar Rapids, and a person we know
the least about, was Osgood Shepherd, who was a hunter and trapper and
who is said to have erected the first log cabin on the banks of the
Cedar river where the Y. M. C. A. building now stands, unless Wilbert
Stone's claim is correct that he was first. When Robert Ellis came to
the Shepherd tavern in April or May, 1838, Shepherd had lived here for
some time. He had a wife and his father was living with him at that
time, and he also had a number of men who hung about his place, but
what their business was no one knew. The log house was about 16x20,
covered with clapboards which were held in place by logs on top with
ends protruding at the gables. There were also in the family three
children, who made things lively about the house. This small cabin was
known as Shepherd's Tavern. From Mr. Ellis's description of Shepherd,
he was more than six feet tall, of a sandy or reddish complexion, was
good natured as a rule and was an accommodating and agreeable landlord.
He was accused of being a horse thief, but Mr. Ellis does not know that
he ever engaged in this kind of business. However, this is true, that
his morals were not of the highest order and it is believed that he
harbored horse thieves who, in fact, were his special favorites. On the
various islands in the river they secreted their stolen goods. It was
also stated that in Wisconsin he was convicted of horse stealing and
sent to the penitentiary, but how true this is no one knows. His father
and one or two children died here and were buried on top of the hill
where the Cedar Rapids Candy Company's large building has since been
erected. Mr. Ellis says that Shepherd told him he was from New York
state and for some time had been a sailor on the lakes before coming
west. He held all the land as a squatter, and when N. B. Brown, Addison
Daniels, H. G. Angle, and others came they had to buy Shepherd off in
order to get title to this property. The patent to this land was dated
December 1, 1845, although quit claim deeds and prior rights were dated
in 1843, Addison Daniels and Nicholas B. Brown being the patentees. The
patents included grants in the amount of two hundred and sixty-nine
acres, and showed that they had paid the amount due at the land office
at Marion according to the provisions of Act of Congress of April 24,
1820.

Osgood Shepherd had a friend named Bill Fisher, who always stuck by
him, and of whom Shepherd's father used to say, "that when he moved
something was going to happen, but it was not very often that he
moved." He was a slow-going, lazy sort of an individual, and what
Shepherd saw in Fisher, Ellis never knew. Nothing is known of Fisher
and what became of him. In the fall of 1841 Shepherd removed to
Wisconsin and was later killed in a railway accident. His widow married
a person by the name of Carpenter and removed to Linn county, residing
near Center Point. What became of the Shepherd family no one has been
able to learn.

Osgood Shepherd and the pioneer settlers with whom he associated were
perhaps no worse or no better than the average frontiersmen. They had
been trained in hardship and sordid poverty, and the women bore the
stamp of the early pioneers, devoted to their families, shirking no
hardships, ever willing to move westward on account of the freedom
gained and the opportunities offered.

Of a different type of mankind was the progressive, enterprising and
enthusiastic Nicholas B. Brown, who purchased Shepherd's claim, the
most prominent figure in the history of the early days of Cedar Rapids.
Mr. Brown arrived in 1840, purchasing the rights of Shepherd with
Addison Daniels and others. On August 4, 1841, he began surveying what
was then known as Rapids City. He improved the water power which Brown
early foresaw would make the town. A saw mill was completed in 1842 and
the waters of the Cedar began to make its machinery hum; this was the
first real enterprise of which the town could be proud. A woolen
factory was also erected by Brown, which was later disposed of to the
Bryan family. In 1846 and 1847 a grist mill was also added. On account
of his many enterprises in which he had to depend on others Mr. Brown
was involved in much litigation, but he was a born fighter for whatever
he thought was right and accumulated a fortune because he had the
tenacity of purpose to hold on to what he had purchased. As a pioneer
he did some excellent work and certainly was one of the shrewdest
business men of Cedar Rapids in his day and generation.

Mr. Brown was born in the state of New Jersey in 1814, removing as a
young man to the state of Kentucky. His first wife was Catherine Craig,
daughter of Thomas Craig, one of the pioneers. She lived only a few
years. His second wife was Susan Emery, daughter of one of the early
settlers of this city. Mr. Brown died in 1880, one of the most honored
and respected men in the community, survived by his widow and two sons,
Emery Brown and Harry Brown. The widow died in 1909, one of the best
known and most respected in the city, having personally known nearly
all of the settlers in the '50s and '60s.

Dyer Usher is said to have hunted and trapped in Linn county as early
as 1836 in company with one Jim Ames; how true this is cannot be
ascertained, but he did come to locate in 1838. He came of a sturdy
family, was born in Ohio, and at the age of eighteen in 1832 he crossed
the Mississippi, being one of the first white settlers to step upon
Iowa soil. Mr. Usher brought the first divorce suit in Linn county.
This business has grown by leaps and bounds since that time. He
attended for a number of years the old settlers meetings and was a well
known figure in the early days in this county. Mr. Usher was thrifty,
honest, and fair in his dealings. He died December 11, 1894, at the age
of eighty years. His widow, Rosanna Harris, died in 1909 at Covington
at the age of seventy-nine. She was born June 6, 1829, in London,
Canada, and with her parents emigrated to Iowa in 1845. She was united
in marriage to Dyer Usher July 29, 1847. To this union were born twelve
children, of whom five survived her: Willard R., of Alberta, Canada,
Mrs. Alice Harris, of Estherville, Mrs. A. H. Miller, of Cedar Rapids,
Mrs. Ray Lockhart, of Shellsburg, and Dyer N. Usher, of Covington. She
had been a resident of Linn county for sixty-three years.

It is still a disputed question as to who was the first actual settler
on what later became Cedar Rapids. It is true that Shepherd ran a sort
of hotel or tavern and was the best known man in this part of the
country in that early date, but it is not likely that he was the first
man to build a log cabin here. Philip Hull had been located in the
lower end, when Ellis arrived in 1838, and Ellis also found William or
Wilbert Stone in possession of the land on the west side of the river,
and he was the one who staked out what he called "Columbus" in 1838,
having previously staked out Westport and sold his claim to John Henry.

Information as regards William Stone has lately been discovered through
a daughter residing at North Liberty. She states that her father's name
was James Wilbert Stone, but he was commonly called William or Billy;
that he was born in the state of Rhode Island and drifted west into
Iowa in 1832 or 1833, and that he always asserted that he built the
first cabin on land which later became Cedar Rapids. It is said that he
drifted west by way of Muscatine or Rock Island and followed the Cedar
river as far as Ivanhoe, later coming to the rapids of the Cedar river.
Mr. Ellis says that he knew William Stone very well; that he was a
quiet, congenial, splendid fellow, and at this time resided on the west
side, having a claim along the river extending northward to the bluff,
and that a Mr. Galloway claimed south of a large cottonwood tree on the
same side of the river. Stone and Galloway were on good terms and owned
the adjoining claims. John Young and a man by the name of Granger, O.
Shepherd, and Philip Hull were the owners or claimants of the land on
the east side of the river. The daughter of Stone asserts that her
father always said that he first located his claim on the east side of
the river. It may be that Stone may have moved across the river after
Shepherd erected his tavern, and made claim to the land near and
adjoining the rapids. It is intimated by Ellis that Stone and Shepherd
were not on the best of terms and Shepherd, being a large, pompous kind
of a person, he might have driven the more quiet and less assertive new
neighbor across the river. The daughter of William Stone, or James
Wilbert Stone, Mrs. Elizabeth Hrdlicka, states that her father bought
goods and traded with the Indians for furs for some years, and that the
last time her father talked to her he told her that he was sorry he
ever gave up the town of Cedar Rapids but did not think then that it
would amount to anything. In 1843 he removed from what was Cedar Rapids
to the Iowa river and married Elizabeth G. Brown and settled in Oxford
township, Johnson county. To this union were born two girls: one, the
eldest, died and the second girl, Elizabeth, now Mrs. Hrdlicka, was
taken by her grandfather, Joseph Brown, on her mother's death when the
daughter was only four weeks old. After the death of his wife Stone
removed to Hudson, St. Croix county, Wisconsin. He returned to see his
daughter about once a year. He died at the age of forty-eight years in
the state of Wisconsin.

It seems from the story of the daughter of Stone, who is still living,
that James Wilbert Stone was undoubtedly the first actual settler on
the site which later became Cedar Rapids. From investigation it seems
that Shepherd may have jumped Stone's claim and for that reason Stone
removed across the river.

In Bailey & Hair's _Gazetteer_, 1865, the following mention is made of
William Stone: "The next [town site] in order of time was called
Columbus, built by William Stone, in September, 1838. He abandoned his
town the next spring, then being a single log cabin. The site was that
occupied by the present city of Cedar Rapids."

Mr. Stone was a speculator and a trader and had made some money trading
with the Indians prior to the advent of Shepherd. This is true, that
Stone did not harbor any people of unsavory reputations, and his whole
life bears the imprint that he was a gentleman even on the frontier.
Such a person people would not remember as well as a frontier character
like Shepherd. Shepherd, on the other hand, whatever may have been his
failings, was a man of a big heart, who attracted people to him. He had
the love of adventure, and it is not any secret but that he harbored
thieves and gave them more or less encouragement. Mr. Stone, on the
other hand, was an honest, quiet man, the opposite of his neighbor, and
it is not to be wondered at that they did not get along.

Another settler who came here at an early date was O. S. Bowling, or
Bolling, who came in the summer of 1838 making a claim on the west side
of the river and in whose honor Bowling's Hill in the south part of the
town was named. Mr. Bowling was a quiet man, a good neighbor, and one
universally loved by the old settlers.

In June, 1839, came Thomas Gainor and David W. King. These gentlemen
found Wilbert Stone, the Lichtebarger brothers, and the claims of
Young, Hull, Ellis, and Bowling. It is said that Mrs. Rosanna Gainer,
wife of Thomas Gainer, was the first white woman to locate on the west
bank of the river and consequently would be the second woman to locate
in what became Cedar Rapids, Mrs. Osgood Shepherd being the first. Mrs.
Gainer did not reside long in Cedar Rapids, as she died June 8, 1840,
giving birth to a daughter who also died the same summer.

David W. King became one of the most enterprising of the men of that
early day. He ran a ferry, platted the town of Kingston, and died, the
owner of much land, in the autumn of 1854. His death caused much sorrow
in Cedar Rapids.

In July, 1839, arrived Isaac Carroll and family, consisting of nine
persons, all of whom were well known by the early settlers. A son, Rev.
George R. Carroll, has written interestingly of the Carrolls, Weares,
and others of the early settlers in his _Pioneer Life in and Around
Cedar Rapids from 1839 to 1849_.

Another early character was John Vardy, who arrived in July 1841, and
built, it is stated, the first frame house at the corner of Third
street and Sixth avenue, during the summer of 1842. Mr. Vardy was a
cabinet maker and an all-round person in the use of tools. He removed
to Texas in 1856 where he died in the fall of 1878.

Another of the old settlers was Thomas Downing, a native of Posey
county, Indiana, and a tailor by trade who at the age of nineteen
drifted into Iowa and in the early '40s came to Linn county. He was a
clerk in the Daniels Company store, removing in 1855 to Waverly to
conduct a business for Greene Bros., of Cedar Rapids. He died in
Waverly in 1896.

Samuel F. Hook was another of the residents of Cedar Rapids who came in
1845 at the age of twenty-one, a native of the state of Virginia. He
died in 1848, and it is thought he was one of the first, if not the
first, real store keeper within the boundaries of what became Cedar
Rapids.

J. H. Kelsey was born in New York state in 1819, and arrived in Cedar
Rapids in 1848. He was a carpenter by trade. He removed to Vinton in
1863, going later to Nebraska where he passed away some time ago.

Steve L. Pollock, a native of Pennsylvania, arrived in Cedar Rapids in
the early '40s and married Marilla Lucore, a daughter of one of the
early settlers, in March, 1844. He was the pioneer blacksmith and is
supposed to have built the third or fourth house in the city. Harrison
Campbell, it is stated, was the owner of the first blacksmith shop, in
1843. Mr. Pollock emigrated west in 1865 and died in Hood River,
Oregon, in 1902. He was a brother-in-law of William Stewart, one of the
old settlers of this city, both of them well and favorably known among
the early pioneers of Cedar Rapids.

Hiram Deem was a native of Ohio and at the age of twenty-eight or
twenty-nine located at Cedar Rapids and hired out to N. B. Brown. He
helped to build the dam across the river, erected saw mills, and
otherwise was a very useful man in a town with the boom spirit that
Cedar Rapids had at that time. He was also one of the first justices of
the peace and many a scrap was settled in his house, which stood on
First street on the west side. He entered the army and died from
exposure in a hospital boat in January, 1863.

What later became known as "Time Check" was first entered by Farnum
Colby, who came here in 1839 and made his claim along the river about a
mile northwest of the First avenue bridge near Robert Ellis's claim. He
was a native of Pennsylvania and a very useful, hard-working man. From
here he removed to Olin, Jones county, where he died some years ago.

In the early '40s also came Charles R. Mulford from Hoboken, New
Jersey, and at once began as a town merchant, opening a store in the
Vardy house on Third street and Sixth avenue. He was one of the most
wide-awake business men of that day and had a good business, but was
caught with the gold fever and emigrated in 1849 to California, where
he died.

One of the best known men in the state in an early date was Col.
William H. Merritt. Mr. Merritt was born in New York city September 12,
1820, and received a fair education at Lima Seminary. At the age of
eighteen he was compelled to rely on his own resources and sought the
west, settling in Rock Island, Illinois, where he obtained a clerkship.
Through government officials and others he was sent to Ivanhoe on the
Red Cedar river in 1839 to take charge of an Indian trading depot.
Ivanhoe was a squatter town, being staked out in October, 1838, by
Anson Cowles. To this place, which was expected to become a large
trading center, came also at the same time George Greene, who taught
school in the vicinity during the winter of 1839. Mr. Merritt ran the
store with considerable ability, and long before the Civil war showed
his presence of mind and bravery. At this time, like in all other
stores of its kind, whiskey, tobacco, and groceries were sold over the
same counter, and one day a number of Indians came, insisting on buying
"goody toss," designated in English as whiskey. Mr. Merritt refused, as
he had such orders from his employers, but the Indians insisted and
began to take possession of the store, and intended to drive the young
clerk out. A few pioneer hangers-on fled, but not so the young clerk in
charge of the goods and the store. He got hold of an axe and with this
he cleaned out single handed a whole squad of Indians, who left as
quickly as they had made their appearance, much to the surprise of the
white settlers, who up to this time had always fled when the redskins
outnumbered them ten to one.

Mr. Merritt was related to George Greene by marriage, and the two men
were much together from this time on. Mr. Merritt became clerk in the
Assembly at Burlington in 1841 and in company with George Greene edited
the _Miners' Express_ at Dubuque. Later he was caught with the gold
fever rush and emigrated to California, returning in 1851, becoming
once more editor and part owner of the old paper. In 1855 he removed to
Ft. Dodge, being appointed registrar of the land office at that place.
He returned once more to Cedar Rapids and founded a banking house under
the style of Greene, Merritt & Co., which firm later disposed of their
banking interests to Sampson C. Bever. He was nominated for governor
on the democratic ticket in 1861 but was defeated by Samuel J.
Kirkwood. Later he enlisted and served with distinction during the
Civil war.

After the war Colonel Merritt became editor of the _Statesman_, one of
the leading democratic papers of the state. He died at his home in Des
Moines in 1891, mourned by a large circle of friends all over the
state. Colonel Merritt was for half a century one of the most all-round
men in Iowa and a leader of his party.

The Weare family arrived here in 1848 and for more than fifty years
were prominent factors in the upbuilding of Cedar Rapids. John Weare
became a noted banker and railroad promoter. Charles Weare became
engaged in constructing railroads and took charge of large contracts,
was mayor of Cedar Rapids, postmaster, and consul in foreign countries.
He was also connected with the First National Bank of Cedar Rapids, as
well as with the Cedar Rapids Water Company. George Weare became a
noted banker in Sioux City, and P. B. Weare and Ely E. Weare promoters
and members of the board of trade in the city of Chicago. Later they
promoted steamboat traffic in the Yukon country at the time of the gold
fever rush. All these were sons of John Weare, Sr., who removed here
from Michigan in the spring of 1845 in order to be with his children
who had previously emigrated. Mr. Weare, Sr., held the office of
justice of the peace up to the time of his death in 1856.

William Stewart, a native of Pennsylvania, located in Cedar Rapids in
1847 and entered the blacksmith shop of Pollock, later putting up his
own shop, and besides operating a large farm. Mr. Stewart removed to
California and died there in 1891, having acquired a fortune in Cedar
Rapids real estate.

Samuel S. Johnson was another Pennsylvanian who came to Cedar Rapids in
1847. He was a carpenter and joiner by trade but gave that up for
farming on arriving in Linn county. Mr. Johnson lived to the grand old
age of eighty-five, and passed away at the home of his daughter, Mrs.
Robert Taylor.

One of the most enterprising, active business men who located in Cedar
Rapids in 1849 was Dr. Seymour D. Carpenter, who was then twenty-three
years of age, and had ostensibly come out here to practice medicine,
but he later turned his attention to land speculations, politics, and
other enterprises. Dr. Carpenter is still residing in Chicago, enjoying
a hale and hearty old age.

In order to give the reader an impression of Cedar Rapids as it was at
that time we shall quote Carpenter's splendid article contained in the
_History of Crescent Lodge_, by J. E. Morcombe, as follows:

     "I turned north and went to Ottumwa where I met Judge
     Greene, then a member of the Supreme Bench of Iowa; he
     persuaded me that Cedar Rapids was in the near future to
     become a metropolis and I decided to go there. After four
     days' hard riding and swimming several swollen streams, I
     struck the town on the afternoon of June 14, 1849; I crossed
     the river on a rope ferry operated by David King, who lived
     in a cabin on the west side; on the other side of the river
     stood a cabin, once the home of a man named Shepherd, and
     said to be the resort of thieves in an early day. I can not
     say that I was very favorably impressed by the thirty or
     forty small one-story unpainted houses that were scattered
     about near the river. There seemed to be a great deal of
     sand, and the houses were so situated that there was no sign
     of a street. There were three two-story houses, one on the
     river near the foot of what is now Third avenue called the
     'Park House' in which the Greenes had their store, one on
     Second street in which John Coffman kept a hotel, and one on
     Third avenue back of the Dows & Ely block, also a hotel. I
     was discouraged and would have travelled further but only
     had about $10.00 left and from necessity had to stop. I put
     up at the Coffman hotel which, as I have said, was a
     two-story structure with a wing; it had been built of
     unseasoned oak lumber and was not plastered; the whole of
     the second story of the main building was in one room and
     contained eight or ten beds and was the common sleeping room
     of the guests. The lumber had shrunk and there could be no
     complaint as to ventilation, however short the
     accommodations might be in other respects....

     "Within a week I made the acquaintance of all the people of
     the town. Among the leading persons were William and Joseph
     Greene, brothers of the Judge, Lowell and Lawson Daniels,
     Homer Bishop and John Weare, all of whom were merchants. The
     three stores of which they were the proprietors would not
     compare well with the department stores of today, but all
     the same they were department stores and in their
     miscellaneous stocks the customer could find all he
     wanted--from castor oil to broad axes.

     "Pollack and Stewart were the blacksmiths, and the
     carpenters and wagon makers were represented, but I can not
     recall their names. There was also a saloon kept by James
     Leverich, a brother of Joe, a respectable man and a good
     Mason. The inhabitants were mostly young people, John Weare,
     Sr., Deacon Kennedy and Porter Earl being the exceptions. I
     found three doctors already located, Dr. Mansfield, Dr.
     Traer and Dr. Larabee, the latter being what was called a
     'steam doctor.' Isaac Cook and Henry Harmon represented the
     law.

     "The town was by no means dull; emigrants were coming daily,
     and the saw mill operated by John Weare, Jr., was kept busy
     cutting lumber for the new houses that were going up. There
     was no church building, but Parson Jones preached in the
     school house, as did preachers of other denominations, and
     Sunday schools and Bible classes were in full blast.

     "On the Fourth of July a grand ball was given at the Coffman
     Hotel, to which flocked young people from Marion and all the
     surrounding country; there were at least fifty couples. The
     beds were removed from our common sleeping quarters, which,
     decorated with green boughs, became a ball room. Every part
     of the house was crowded and the fun was fast and furious.
     Only one mishap slightly marred the festivities; near a
     stove pipe hole at one end of the room the floor was
     defective, and a husky reveler of more than ordinary weight
     while executing the double shuffle broke through and fell
     upon the heads below; no injury was done and the dance went
     on.

     "Dr. Mansfield took me as a partner and in company with
     Judge Cook we had a room 10x16 in a small one-story building
     opposite the mill, the other part being occupied by S. L.
     Pollock and family; his blacksmith shop was nearby. Our
     medicines were kept on a shelf and a store box made a table;
     our bunks occupied one side and a few stools and two split
     bottom chairs made up our furniture. We took our meals at
     the Coffman Hotel; our field of practice embraced the
     settlers, not numerous, in the valleys of the Cedar and Iowa
     rivers and their tributaries; we made very long rides. I was
     called to see a patient two miles above the present town of
     Vinton not yet begun; I got lost in the night and waited for
     daylight under a tree on the bank of the river at the very
     place where Vinton now stands. Bilious fever and ague were
     the prevailing diseases, all the newcomers having to undergo
     one or both....

     "We had mail three times a week from Dubuque and Iowa City;
     the Higley brothers did the service in a two-horse hack; I
     think Joseph Greene was postmaster. John Weare, Sr., was
     justice of the peace; he was a very original character, fond
     of company and full of interesting reminiscences extending
     back to the war of 1812 in which he had lost a leg. His
     small office was in the rear of Mrs. Ely's residence which
     stood on the ground where the Dows and Ely block now is. He
     gave 'nicknames' to many people and places which stuck to
     them like burrs; the First Presbyterian church building was
     begun that summer and as the walls were built of cement, Old
     Mr. Weare named it 'The Muddy,' which it retained to the
     last day of its existence."

Dr. Carpenter states how they tried to promote a railway from Cascade
to Fairfield, held meetings concerning railway extensions, and
appointed delegates from various counties to these conventions to
discuss the matter fully and to authorize the government to donate land
and have eastern people furnish the money. He says:

     "Dr. J. F. Ely and myself were selected to go to Fairfield;
     we left Cedar Rapids on December 3 and after a three days'
     hard and cold travel reached Fairfield; Marion sent Col. I.
     M. Preston and Dr. Ristine. The convention met in a small
     school house; all the counties were represented; the Hon. C.
     W. Slagle, of Fairfield, then a very young man, was chosen
     president, and I was chosen secretary....

     "We departed for our various homes thinking the work half
     done, but sad to relate Cedar Rapids had to wait ten years
     longer for a locomotive. These two meetings were, I think,
     the first railroad conventions held in the interior of the
     state. Soon opposition claims were started for east and west
     lines and our project was ignominiously called the 'Ram's
     Horn.' The next year was quite a stirring one; new people
     were coming in great numbers and many were leaving, for the
     California gold fever had broken out. Several outfits left
     Cedar Rapids, with one of them Dr. Mansfield, my partner,
     whose place was taken by Dr. S. C. Koontz, a cousin of mine,
     well known to the old citizens.

     "That year the first brick buildings were erected; a
     dwelling on Iowa avenue, near Greene's opera house, and a
     three-story building on Commercial street by Judge Greene,
     which for a long time was the show building of the town; we
     began to put on airs.

     "In the spring of 1852 a steamboat came to Cedar Rapids; it
     was a great event and attracted people from near and far;
     she brought a cargo of freight, among which were the
     household effects of Mr. Bever and my father, both of whom
     from that time forward became citizens of the town. This
     year, also, came Mr. Daniel O. Finch with a printing press
     and forthwith started the _Progressive Era_, the first paper
     in the Cedar valley. [The _Era_ was established in 1851.]
     Ezra Van Metre, a talented young lawyer from Circleville,
     Ohio, also came that year. Everyone was rejoiced that we had
     an organ and the editor was overwhelmed with original
     matter. There were at least a dozen young fellows in the
     town, myself among the rest, who thought they 'knew it all,'
     and anxiously rushed into print. The paper changed hands in
     a year or two, and became the _Cedar Valley Times_, and
     continued until a few years ago."

Dr. Carpenter sold his practice to Dr. Koontz and went into the land
business and in politics. Again we must quote what he has to say about
the county seat fight which commenced the first few years he was here:

     "Cedar Rapids claimed that she was to be the commercial
     metropolis and therefore ought to be the political center.
     The question was brought to an issue by the county
     commissioners ordering a new court house at Marion, subject
     to the approval of the voters of the county. Cedar Rapids
     opposed the measure, believing that the building would
     insure the permanent location of the county seat. Then
     ensued a most bitter canvass. The voters were deluged with
     oratory. Marion put on the stump Judge Isbell, I. M.
     Preston, Col. William Smyth, N. M. Hubbard, W. G. Thompson,
     and R. D. Stephens, against whom Cedar Rapids opposed Jas.
     J. Child, Ezra Van Metre, Donald McIntosh, A. S. Belt, E. N.
     Bates, I. N. Whittam and others. Every school district was
     canvassed and much bitter feeling engendered. The Marion
     people were more adroit politicians and carried the
     election, but the result did not discourage our citizens,
     who asserted that no election could affect 'manifest
     destiny.'

[Illustration: MILL AT PRAIRIEBURG]

     "About 1852 Major J. M. May came to Cedar Rapids from
     Janesville, Wisconsin. The Major was a stirring man with a
     head full of schemes. He said that Cedar Rapids was a place
     of immense possibilities and only wanted enterprise to make
     it the great town of Iowa. He bought land at the lower part
     of town adjoining that owned by my father, and land on the
     west side adjoining the river and below that owned by David
     King. He platted out town lots on both sides of the river,
     and induced my father and King to do the same, which were
     the first additions made to the original town. He also
     surveyed the island, sent a plat to the general government
     and took possession of it, much to the chagrin and surprise
     of the old settlers. Then he began to agitate the question
     of a free bridge. Everyone wanted a free bridge but were
     undecided as to the location. The Major induced my father to
     subscribe $1500.00, and he gave $1000.00, which with sums
     contributed by others in the lower end of the town secured
     the location below the island at the narrowest place in the
     river. The bridge was completed and thrown open to the
     public, I think, in the late fall of 1852, and proved a
     great convenience. The construction was defective and when
     the ice broke up in the spring, the heavy cakes knocked down
     two of the piers, and destroyed the greater part of the
     bridge. All the people of the town were collected on the
     bank of the river watching the event, and two young women
     who were crossing went down with the structure and were
     drowned. This was the first bridge built at Cedar Rapids.
     The next was a bridge of boats at the foot of Iowa avenue
     which I believe was also swept away by ice."

Dr. Carpenter speaks next of the formation of the real company who had
money and who meant business in the formation of what was then known as
the "Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska Railway," which built from Clinton to
Cedar Rapids and to the Missouri river. "Cedar Rapids was given first
directors as follows: Geo. Greene, John Weare, H. G. Angle, S. C. Bever
and S. D. Carpenter, which positions we held till the road was built to
Cedar Rapids."

In speaking of the amount of money put up by these men in order to get
this railway it is said that $200,000.00 was pledged by Cedar Rapids,
which amount was raised as follows: $100,000.00 by private subscription
and $100,000.00 by city bonds. Greene & Weare, then bankers, subscribed
$10,000.00; George Greene, $5,000.00; John Weare, $5,000.00; N. B.
Brown, $5,000.00; S. C. Bever, $5,000.00; Gabriel Carpenter, $5,000.00,
and numerous other smaller sums to make up the amount. Then a city
election was had and the $100,000.00 voted by an overwhelming majority.
Surveys of the route were begun at once, and from Mount Vernon and
Cedar Rapids two lines were seen; one by the way of Marion, and the
other by the river. It was ascertained that the latter route would be
the shorter and cheaper by $100,000.00 than the former, but the company
proposed to adopt the Marion route if she would subscribe $100,000.00.
This she declined to do, and the river line was chosen. Work progressed
slowly and the first year found the rails no further west than De Witt,
Clinton county.

Dr. Carpenter speaks of another railroad venture when a company was
formed known as the "Cedar Rapids & Missouri River Railroad Company"
with L. B. Crocker, of New York, as president, and with Major Bodfish
and a number of Cedar Rapids men as directors.

     "When the legislature assembled in 1859 and 1860 we invaded
     the capital, and established our headquarters in an old
     hotel near the river, the name of which I have forgotten.
     Major Bodfish was the commissary of the body. We had no
     money to expend, but determined to be hospitable. The Major
     laid in a barrel of old rye whiskey; as it was before the
     war, whiskey was cheap; also several boxes of cigars. One of
     our strongest henchmen was J. W. Woodbury, a leading man
     from Marshalltown, and with him Peter Hepburn, now an
     honored congressman, then a very stripling, but showing
     evident signs of what was in him. John A. Kasson was then a
     young lawyer in Des Moines, and we secured him as our
     attorney....

     "The lawmakers were not in a hurry, but towards the last of
     the session they passed our bill, and you may be sure there
     was great rejoicing in Cedar Rapids. On our return the
     citizens gave us a grand banquet in Greene's Hotel, and we
     felt that we had at last secured a substantial victory for
     our city, as in fact it was, for thenceforth Marion could no
     longer be our rival. The cars came to Cedar Rapids in the
     summer of 1859, just ten years after we had our first
     railroad meeting, and we felt at last that hope had ended in
     fruition. An immense concourse greeted their arrival from
     all parts of the surrounding country. General D. N. Sprague,
     then mayor, welcomed the guests, and the citizens threw open
     hospitable doors to all comers. From that time forward Cedar
     Rapids assumed metropolitan airs as the leading town of the
     Cedar valley."

On politics Dr. Carpenter speaks as follows:

     "From the first, on my arrival at Cedar Rapids, I became an
     active partisan. General A. J. McKean of Marion was the
     acknowledged leader, but the following was small. At the
     state convention in 1851, held in Iowa City, I was the sole
     representative from Linn county, and there were not more
     than fifty delegates from the whole state. State officers
     were nominated and also a candidate for congress. Colonel
     Henderson, the father of J. W. Henderson of Cedar Rapids,
     was named for congress, and without much opposition I
     secured the nomination for secretary of state for my friend,
     Isaac Cook, who up to that time was entirely unknown. I well
     remember with what surprise he received the news. Although
     there was no chance for his election it was the beginning
     with him of a long and useful career in many offices of
     trust, alike honorable to him and his constituents. As time
     rolled on and our population of immigrants from the north
     and especially from the New England states, and with the
     bearing of the whig party towards slavery, they became more
     hopeful, and by the year 1853 or 1854, the whigs carried the
     county, electing both members of the legislature and the
     county officers. John P. Conkey was the first member of the
     legislature living in Cedar Rapids, and at the same election
     Isaac Cook was chosen for a county office.

     "About this time Charles Weare, Isaac Cook and many others
     cut loose from their old convictions and became ardent free
     soilers."

Dr. Carpenter speaks of how he abandoned medicine, how he opened a
banking house in 1855, and became a land owner, having at one time as
much as 1,600 acres of land near where the town of Norway now stands.
He was first connected with Lehman & Kreider, later forming the
partnership of Carpenter, Stibbs & Company, the firm doing business
until 1861. Dr. Carpenter attended the convention at Chicago that
nominated Lincoln and was one of the first to enlist in the Civil war
as a surgeon. He was mustered out in 1865.

Henry E., Harvey G., Wellington W., and Major M. A. Higley were for a
generation merchants, financiers, and leaders in many enterprises in
Cedar Rapids. They were born in the state of Connecticut, coming to
this county in the early '40s. Henry and Harvey Higley for some time
operated a line of stages from Dubuque to Iowa City, and for that
reason knew personally nearly all the prominent men of Iowa in the '40s
and '50s. Iowa City being the capital and Dubuque the most enterprising
city in the territory and state, the public men frequently travelled to
and from these cities. Harvey Higley "got caught" with the gold fever
and went to California, returning in a few years to Cedar Rapids. The
Higley brothers made large fortunes in real estate which have descended
to their children.

The brothers, C. J. and Jacob A. Hart, natives of Maryland, came to
Cedar Rapids in the early '50s, and for a generation were two of the
most successful lumber dealers in Cedar Rapids.

Alexander L. Ely was one of the early millers, who died in the '40s.
His brother, Dr. J. F. Ely, came later to look after the business
interests of his deceased brother, and for some fifteen or twenty years
was a successful practitioner in Cedar Rapids. He and his wife for a
generation were leaders of the business and social life of this city.

Homer Bishop was an old-time merchant, arriving in the early '40s, and
for eight years was postmaster of Cedar Rapids. He was a congenial
person, well known, and an enterprising and free-hearted man who did
his best to build up a city on what was then thought to be the western
frontier.

No doubt the first Scandinavian settler to locate within the confines
of Linn county was Nels C. Boye, a native of Denmark, who emigrated to
the United States in 1827 and arrived in Muscatine in 1837 and located
in the vicinity of Lisbon in 1838 where he purchased land and engaged
in farming. Being brought up as a merchant he removed with his family
to Iowa City in 1843 and for a time operated one of the most up-to-date
stores in the new capital. On a business trip to St. Louis in 1849 he
fell a victim to the cholera and died there on June 23. A number of his
children continued to reside in Linn county, and a number of relations
are still residents of this county.

One of the old settlers of Ivanhoe was Dr. S. Grafton, who arrived
there in 1843 and travelled horseback up and down the Cedar and Iowa
river valleys as far as Jones or as far northeast as half way to
Dubuque in the practice of his profession. He was born in Ohio in 1800,
and died during the typhoid epidemic in 1845 and 1847. He was one of
the best known of the early physicians, a gentleman, a scholar, and a
man who did, perhaps, more during the few years of his practice to help
the poor and the needy than any other of the early settlers. He was
married to Isabelle Patterson, also a resident for many years of East
Liverpool, Ohio, but born in Pennsylvania. After the death of Dr.
Grafton she married Herman Boye, a son of Nels C. Boye. Mr. Boye was a
cabinet maker and farmer. He got caught with the gold fever and
emigrated to California in 1850, returning to Ivanhoe within a few
years. It is said that he made more money in California seining for
fish, which he had learned in Denmark, than he did in digging gold. He
died in 1880 at the age of sixty-two years. The widow died January 11,
1897, at the advanced age of eighty years, and is buried at Mount
Vernon.

Another of the old settlers of Bertram may be mentioned--Joseph Crane,
a cousin of James Doty, who has the honor, at least, of obtaining the
first license to marry within the Territory, viz: in 1840 when he was
married to Agnes Boghart.

The first settlers seem to have been William Abbe, Daniel Hahn, C. C.
Haskins, and Edward M. Crow. Which one of these men actually was the
first settler within the confines of the county may ever remain a
disputed question. We have the record when they entered lands, but this
does not at all indicate that they did not live on these lands for
several years before actual entry was made. The first settler in the
vicinity of what became Mount Vernon was, no doubt, Charles Haskins,
who located about a mile and a half east of the village in the summer
of 1837. He was at least one of the first to locate in that vicinity.
It is said that Daniel Hahn came in the spring of 1837, made a claim
and built a log cabin, his wife assisting him in building the house.
Edward M. Crow has been supposed to have been the first settler, but it
seems that he came in July, 1837, in company with his brother, and
located near what later became known as Viola, where he made a claim
and erected a small shanty. He returned to the Fox river settlement for
provisions and did not come back until in August, when he was
accompanied by his brother and by James Dawson. About this time also
came Joselyn and Russell. Their cabins were located in the back woods
in Brown township and was called "The Settlement" for some time.

Later in the fall of 1837 arrived Jacob Mann, having resided previously
in Jones county. He located on what was known as "Big Creek" in Linn
county, but he did not take possession of his rude cabin or claim until
in February, 1838, when he and his daughter, Sarah, moved onto the
claim and began housekeeping. He afterward built a grist mill on Big
creek or purchased one built by John Oxley which was swept away in the
spring of 1851, when Mann lost his life, refusing to leave his mill
which, he said, "was dearer to him than his own life."

Sally Mann is supposed to have been, if not the first white woman in
the county, at least one of the first, and many are the stories told of
Sally, or rather Sarah, Mann. She was more masculine than feminine in
her make-up and knew few of the customs and manners of good society.
She raised cats for a living and used to sell these at fancy prices to
the pioneer settlers. There was nothing attractive about Sally, for she
was noted more for her strength and endurance than for grace and
beauty. But even though Sally had very little to recommend her, women
were scarce in those days and the settlers were, perhaps, not so
particular as they later became, and on July 21, 1840, Sally Mann and
Aaron Haynes were duly married by John Crow, a justice of the peace.
Sally Haynes nee Mann, had many good traits of character. No one was
turned away from her door hungry and she would help neighbors with any
kind of work if necessary. The western life appealed to her, as it had
to the members of her family, and when settlers came thick and fast she
and her husband left for the far west in order, it was said, that they
could breathe the pure air of the frontier. It was always thus.

     "'Tis not the fairest form that holds
       The mildest, purest soul within;
     'Tis not the richest plant that holds
       The sweetest fragrance in."

Gabriel Carpenter, a native of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was born in
1801. He arrived in Cedar Rapids in 1852 and invested all his funds in
500 acres of land in what has now become the heart of the city. Various
additions in this city have been named in honor of this early real
estate owner, who devoted all his time in the upbuilding of this city
until his death in 1881. Mr. Carpenter saw many hardships in his early
career in life, but with great perseverance overcame all. The first
lumber he used was hauled by oxen from Muscatine. He became early
interested in various enterprises in the city. He always gave liberally
of his means to all worthy objects and assisted in advancing all public
enterprises which he believed would prove a benefit to the city. His
widow, Mrs. Maria Carpenter, born in 1820, is still living and resides
in this city, honored and respected by all.

Dr. S. D. Carpenter was born in 1826, and is a son of Gabriel
Carpenter. In the early fifties he came to Cedar Rapids and located
here for the practice of medicine. He soon gave up medicine for the
more exciting and more lucrative vocation of railway building, banking,
and handling of real estate. He now resides in Chicago.

John E. Kurtz was born in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, in 1817,
emigrated to Iowa in 1847, and became one of the founders of Lisbon. He
was for more than half a century a well known farmer, merchant, and
miller. In early life Mr. Kurtz was a whig in politics, later going
over to the republican party. A large number of his descendants still
reside in this county.

Peter D. Harman was a native of Adams county, Pennsylvania, where he
was born in 1816. In 1840 he came to Iowa City, locating in Linn county
two years later. Mr. Harman assisted in the building of the state
capitol at Iowa City, and also in the erection of the first court house
in Linn county. In his day and generation Mr. Harman was considered one
of the most skillful stone and brick masons in this part of the
country. He died in Bertram township in 1896, and is survived by a
number of children who are residents of this county.

Barnett Lutz came to Linn county in 1839 and was one of the best known
of the old settlers. At the time of his death in 1901 he was one of the
oldest pioneers in the county. Mr. Lutz was a true pioneer, and did
much in building up the new country.

C. J. Ives was not a pioneer settler in Linn county, but he was a
pioneer in developing railway properties in the state. Mr. Ives was a
native of New England, coming to Lee county in 1847, drifting into
mining in Colorado, and not till 1862 did he turn his attention to
railroading. He was for a number of years president of the B., C. R. &
N. railway, which he developed into one of the best paying railway
properties in the west. He resigned when that road was absorbed by the
Rock Island system. Mr. Ives during his long residence in Linn county
was deeply interested in the welfare of his employees, and in the
upbuilding of Cedar Rapids. He was also interested in banks, electric
light companies, and other large enterprises. He was a practical
business man, capable and forceful, with a mind ever active in planning
and executing great things. He was universally respected by his
employees, and never forgot in word, act, or deed that he was only an
associate and not a superior. No railway official at the time of his
death a few years ago had more friends among the railroad men than Mr.
Ives.

David W. King, the founder of Kingston, settled in Linn county in 1839
when Indians were numerous and the white settlers scattered. Mr. King
was a native of Westmorland county, Pennsylvania, who went to Michigan
early and from there drove an ox team across the country to Iowa,
entering land on the west side of the river, which land is now a part
of Cedar Rapids. Mr. King operated the first ferry across the Cedar
river and had to obtain his material for the erection of the same from
Dubuque and Muscatine, all of which was hauled in wagons across the
country. The cable used in operating the ferry was of wire, which was
brought from Dubuque on horseback. The town of Kingston he platted in
1850. Mr. King was a real promoter, who early comprehended the future
of Cedar Rapids. In order to induce people to locate on the west side
of the river he was liberal and public-spirited, giving away many lots
for factory sites and other enterprises. He passed away in 1854 at the
age of forty-six, just at a time when he had attained to a prominent
place as one of the leading citizens of the town, in the promotion of
which he had devoted all his time and versatile talents.

Robert Smyth, who died in 1898 at his home at Mount Vernon, was in many
respects one of the most enterprising men in Linn county. Born in
Ireland in 1814, and emigrating to America in 1834, he drifted into
Linn county in 1840 and soon became an extensive dealer in real estate,
as well as a banker, and during all his life took an active part in
politics. He was a member of the Sixth Territorial legislature in
1843-44, a member of the state legislature in 1846-48. Mr. Smyth was
also paymaster of the United States army, disbursing more than
$10,000,000.00 during his term of office. In 1868 he was once more
returned to the state senate where he served for four years, and in
1884 served another term in the house. He was also delegate to many
state conventions, and outside of the late Charles Weare knew more of
the public men of Iowa than any other man in Linn county. Mr. Smyth was
a brother of William Smyth, the well known jurist, who died a member of
congress from this district.

Edward M. Crow, by some people believed to be the first actual white
settler in the county, was born in Orange county, Indiana, in 1816 of
ancestors who had previously emigrated from North Carolina. John Crow,
the father, came to Linn county to the neighborhood of Viola in 1838,
and there he died in March, 1841. It is thought that Ed Crow crossed
the Mississippi river in 1837 and on July 4th laid claim to a tract of
land on section 13 in Brown township. Thus, it would seem, that Abbe
preceded him by several months. In company with Crow at that time there
came Harrison Crow, a brother, as well as James Dawson, who built
cabins on what is now known as Crow's creek near Viola. They also put
up a little hay that fall. Thus, while these were among the first
settlers, it must be conceded that they did not precede Abbe, Haskins,
or Hahn in locating in Linn county. Ed Crow, it is true, was one of the
early settlers and well known, a typical pioneer, but he was not the
first settler, although he arrived in the historic year of 1837, when
the white settlers were beginning to move into the territory not yet
vacated by the red men.

In mentioning the men who were factors in the upbuilding of Iowa,
Theodore S. Parvin should not be omitted. During his residence in Linn
county he devoted most of his time to the upbuilding of a unique
Masonic library. He was known throughout the United States as one of
the leaders of that order. Mr. Parvin's love of collecting together
many things was only one of the many sidedness of a remarkable
personage. Mr. Parvin was born in Cedarville, New Jersey. Educated in
the east, he drifted west to Cincinnati and there met Robert Lucas,
recently appointed governor of Iowa Territory. Mr. Parvin had been a
teacher and had been admitted to the bar so he was well qualified for
his mission as secretary to the governor. After coming to Burlington
Mr. Parvin was United States attorney, clerk of the federal court,
registrar of the state land office, and for many years professor and
regent of the State University of Iowa. During all these years he
lectured and wrote much. He died June 28, 1901, one of the most widely
known and most honored men in the state. "Steadfast in faith, without
trace of cant, he walked the ways of life with simple trust in the
Infinite wisdom and passed to his death relying on the guidance of an
unseen hand," says his biographer.

Julius E. Sanford was one of the platters of the city of Cedar Rapids,
and was a wide-awake, enterprising young man who for a while was in
partnership with N. W. Isbell. Mr. Sanford was a native of Connecticut
and was well educated on coming west where he took up the practice of
the law and engaged in real estate. He removed to Dubuque in 1845,
where he died in 1847, leaving a widow, Henrietta E. Sanford, who in
1848 married David Wilson. She died in 1898. Perit Sanford, who figures
in early real estate transfers, was the father of Julius Sanford, and
heir of the estate, as the son died without children.

Thomas Craig was an old settler in Linn county, and one of the best
known men in the community. Mr. Craig was odd in some ways. He wore a
white overcoat and had a fondness for horses. He was a stanch
Methodist, and at times would be reprimanded, for he refused to lead in
prayer. Mr. Craig died many years ago, respected and honored by all
with whom he had come in contact. One of his daughters was married to
N. B. Brown and another to Jesse Beechly, who recently died in his old
homestead in Franklin township.

Dr. Eber L. Mansfield was born in Canaan, Ohio, in 1821. He received a
classical education and also took a medical course later. On leaving
home his father gave him a horse, saddle-bags, and an outfit, and he
started out for himself. He taught school in Kentucky and then came
overland on horseback to Iowa in 1847, crossing the Cedar river near
the lower bridge. He was assisted by W. W. and M. A. Higley, two young
men who later became his friends and fellow workers in the upbuilding
of Cedar Rapids. The gold fever of 1850 took the doctor away from his
practice, and by August, 1850, he had arrived at the gold diggings. On
the way he had made money, as he doctored a great many who were sick
with fevers. He purchased two teams and did teaming from Sacramento to
Shaw's Flats for about two years when he got tired and sold out,
returning by way of Panama and New Orleans. He came back to Cedar
Rapids, which city remained his home until his death. Dr. Mansfield was
one of the best known and most successful physicians of his day and
generation. He invested in city real estate, in bank stock, and was
stockholder in insurance companies. His was a rugged, strong character.
He early saw the possibilities of the city, and was one of the first to
invest in its real estate. He erected brick buildings in the heart of
the city which are now owned by his children, and are very valuable.

William Rogers, a native of Ohio, where he was born in 1830, came to
Linn county and settled in Rogers Grove in the early forties. Mr.
Rogers was an enterprising man and was one of the first to erect a saw
mill and to raft lumber down the river to Muscatine in order to find a
market for it. In an age when straw sheds were common he went to work
and erected one of the best and largest barns in the country. In this
barn he stacked his grain and threshed it by walking the horses over
it, the wheat dropping through the floor to a floor below where it was
cleaned. Mr. Rogers died many years ago, one of the best known men in
southern Linn county. His widow, Elizabeth McNie, is still living,
making her home with her son, James M. Rogers, of Fairfax township.

Chandler Jordan, born in 1820 in the state of Maine, came to Linn
county in 1844, where he made his home until his death a short time
ago. Mr. Jordan was a lifelong member of the Baptist church, which he
supported and in which he was an active worker all his life. He was
interested in the public schools, and in public affairs in general.
Jordan's Grove is named in honor of this sturdy old pioneer.

G. W. Matsell, for many years a resident of Buffalo township, where he
owned some 2,000 acres of land which he purchased at an early day, was
a well known character in New York city in the old days of Tammany
Hall. He was chief of police and a prominent politician for many years
till the breaking up of the party with which he was closely associated.
Then he came here where his family still resides. Mr. Matsell of course
spent much time in New York, where he had financial interests, but he
liked the west and enjoyed the summers in Iowa. He was a democrat of
the old school, but never entered into the game of politics after
coming west, having had his fill of it in the New York political ring
for many years.

The Matsell home was a hospitable one and many were the people George
Matsell entertained during his residence in Iowa. Visitors came from
all over the country, for he was well known. Mr. Matsell entertained
royally and knew how to entertain. The history of New York city cannot
be written without the mention of G. W. Matsell, police chief, a member
of the Committee of Seventy, and a well known character for many years
during the stormy days of the Civil war. His son still resides on the
old homestead.

Robert Safely was a native of Scotland. He emigrated to New York at the
age of fourteen. He saw the first engine to run with steam in the state
of New York. For many years Mr. Safely was master mechanic for the old
B., C. R. & N. system, and was a familiar figure on the streets of
Cedar Rapids up to the time of his death, a short time ago. Mr. Safely
was an expert mechanic and up to the time of his death was interested
in everything pertaining to mechanical science.

Many of our earlier citizens only remained here for a shorter or longer
time and left for other parts where they later attained to prominence.
Who does not remember W. H. Ingham, one of Kossuth county's pioneers,
who lived in this county in 1850 and for five years was engaged in
surveying and locating lands for early settlers? Judge Thomas Burke, a
noted character of Seattle and now wealthy, tried his luck at the law
here waiting for clients who never came. When Mr. Burke was picked up
by J. J. Hill on the coast then every one wanted this once briefless
barrister as his legal adviser. Bishop C. C. McCabe lived here for a
number of years, and no one had any idea that the rollicky, fun-making,
joking young beardless lad in the employ of Judge Greene and others
would develop into a great lecturer and a Methodist bishop. Dr. J. T.
Headley, of lecture fame, practiced medicine here in the late sixties,
and was a quiet, unassuming man, who minded his own business and
devoted days and nights to books and science. Here lived for some years
the eloquent divine, Rev. Fawcett, a person of great eloquence and
force of character who left Cedar Rapids better for having lived in it.
One cannot forget Rev. Elias Skinner, now living in Waterloo, also a
Methodist minister of force and eloquence who at various times lived in
Linn county. Rev. Skinner, despite his eighty-three years, is well and
hearty and can relate many things which occurred in this county in the
fifties and sixties. He writes as follows:

     "I think Linn county is about the very best county in Iowa.
     Five different times I had my home in old Linn. I never did
     anything worthy of special mention at either time. In each
     of the four places where I lived I blundered into doing
     things which I would rather not have recalled. So please
     excuse me. I write with pencil because I can't guide a pen.

                                  "Yours,

                                                E. SKINNER."


COL. DURHAM TO THE OLD SETTLERS--ADDRESS BEFORE ASSOCIATION.
AUGUST 1902

_Ladies and Gentlemen of the Old Settlers' Society_: In calling this
assemblage to order I wish to say to you all, to the new-comers, the
strangers who honor us with their presence, that, in the name of our
society, we bid you a most hearty welcome and say as a good hostess
would, come again.

Many of you I knew in territorial times, when we were seeking and
establishing new homes, in the far new country beyond the Mississippi,
and aiding in our humble way to lay the foundation of the present
famous commonwealth of Iowa. The first settlements were made along and
near the Mississippi river. There were but two counties, Dubuque and
Des Moines, and the country was called the Black Hawk Purchase. The
purchase negotiated with the Sac and Fox Indians, by General Scott and
Governor Reynolds, at the close of the Black Hawk war, consisted of a
strip averaging about fifty miles wide, beginning in the northeastern
part of the state and running to the north boundary of Missouri, though
not on a straight line, at a point fifty miles west of the river. It
was under the jurisdiction of the territory of Michigan, and was
represented in congress, as a territorial delegate, by George Wallace
Jones.

In 1837 a few townships in the northwestern part of this county were
surveyed by a surveyor general deputy named Haight. And soon thereafter
Edward Crow and a few other adventurers came. Their only roads were
fragments of Indian trails. They were delighted with the country and
the smooth, polished surface of the unbroken prairie in all the
grandeur and sublimity of its primeval state. Sages have sung of the
charms seen in the face of such solitudes and I would say that I never
felt nearer the great Creator and Ruler of the universe than when in
regions before untrod by civilized man, where the forces of nature
reigned supreme, and no sounds broke the silence except the hoo-hooing
of owls, the drumming of pheasants, the bugle notes of the swan, the
quacking of smaller fowls, the barking of prairie wolves, and in a
timbered country, the hungry, desolate howl of the large wolf, and
sometimes, though seldom, the piteous wail of the panther. It's no
wonder that Moses retired to the top of a distant mountain with the
roar of thunder and the flashes of lightning beneath him to talk with
God.

In 1838 another strip of country was acquired from the Indians,
embracing the remainder of Linn county. Possession was given in 1839,
when a continuous immigration commenced, which dates back to the coming
of many of the families represented here today, our respected secretary
among them, and not long after that our treasurer. Previous to its
organization in 1839, Linn county was, with Jones county, attached for
judicial, revenue, and election purposes to Jackson county. In 1838 the
territory of Iowa was struck off from Wisconsin, Robert Lucas was
appointed governor by President Van Buren, and William Wallace Chapman
was elected first delegate to congress, with both of whom I was
acquainted in the constitutional convention in 1844. Governor Lucas was
a Virginian by birth, though raised in Ohio, where he had served as
governor. He was one of nature's noblemen, not for pomposity and fine
equipage, but for all the traits that make up true manhood--modesty,
courage, honesty, integrity, patriotism, and morality.

Soon after the organization of the territory the Missouri war began.
This related to the boundary line between the two states. It lasted
some time, but like the Ohio and Michigan war, was bloodless, though a
good deal of patriotism and red tape and military titles were shed. The
trouble was finally settled by the surveyors and the courts.

In 1839 Linn county was organized. The first officers were John C.
Berry, commissioner's clerk or auditor; Hosea W. Gray, sheriff; Dr.
Tryon, clerk of the court; Luman W. Strong, Samuel C. Stewart, and
Peter McRoberts, county commissioners. Squire Strong was a potential
factor in all Linn county affairs. Mr. Stewart was distinguished for
his piety. His wife was a sister of those sturdy pioneers, the Scott
brothers. In 1840 the territory contained 43,000 inhabitants; Augustus
C. Dodge was elected delegate to congress, and George Greene a member
of the territorial council, or senate, to represent Cedar, Linn, and
Jones counties. In 1841 the remainder of Linn county was surveyed by
the United States deputies, with all of whom I was acquainted and in
their camps--but chiefly with Mr. Welden.

After these surveys were made, claim-making and improving and trading
became very lively, and the ratio of immigration increased all the
time. There was more disturbance and trouble and fighting about claims
than from all other causes put together. I will give only a few
instances of the many with which I am acquainted. A man by the name of
Wolcott, near Mount Vernon, had his claim entered. He reported it to
the claim association. They sent a committee of three men to the
intruder and demanded that he should release and cancel his purchase,
which he refused to do. Whereupon they procured a conveyance and told
him that he must go to Dubuque with them. Knowing the settler's law was
against him, he made no further resistance, but went before the
register and receiver, cancelled his entry, and his money was returned
to him. The matter came up shortly after that before the grand jury at
Marion on the charge of coercion and kidnapping. Samuel Hunter, Sr., of
Hunter's Cross Roads, was one of the jury, Joseph Williams was judge,
P. W. Earle, clerk, and Nathan Peddycord, of Yankee Grove, was another
juryman, and I was foreman. William Abbe and Squire Waln of Mount
Vernon were witnesses. Robert Smith was secretary of the claim
association and Oliver Day or Allison Willits president. No bill was
found and the matter stopped and never reached the supreme court.

Another claim case originated in the Dry Creek country, and came to a
climax in a rather exciting way. There were a number of us attending an
Indian banquet and pow-wow at a place called Wick-i-up Hollow, near the
Cedar river, two or three miles south of the Oliphant and Ashlock
neighborhood. The regular guests were seated in a semi-circle in the
wick-i-up; we were only callers. The exercises consisted of short
talks, chants and choruses, each keeping time with a deer's bladder
dried and filled with air and some buckshot in it to make it rattle,
all accompanied with the music of a sort of home made fife. The banquet
or dinner to follow was being cooked by the women. It consisted, as far
as I could see, of dried venison, stewed dog meat, beans, and pancakes.
Before the dinner was ready some of our party went outside and renewed
a quarrel that had been pending for some time about their claims.
Pretty soon the lie was passed, and it was immediately followed by a
blow, and directly five or six were in the fight all at once. The
struggle and angry shouts of the combatants frightened some of the
Indian women who were near and they ran screaming away. This broke up
the exercise in the wick-i-up and the braves rushed out, thinking that
their women were being misused, for a brave man will always resent an
insult to his wife. The fight so disrupted everything that we left
without waiting for dinner, especially as some had to withdraw for
repairs. The Chambers were in it. William Garrison and some of the
Nations were in it, but not Carrie with her little hatchet. John Hunter
and, I think, Dyer Usher, were there, but not in the fight. The case
came up before his honor, Aaron Usher, a justice of the peace, who
fined some of the participants $1.00 each, which ended the litigation
and the claim dispute.

The last claim case I will mention was of much greater magnitude, and
out of it originated the Bill Johnson war, in which several lives were
lost, including one Indian. It began in Buchanan county. William
Bennett and a man purporting to be Bill Johnson of the Canadian patriot
war were the principles in the extensive trouble. Bennett was an
enterprising, public-spirited man and had a quantity of workmen and
retainers helping build the first grist mill at Quasqueton, on the
Wapsipinicon river. He was a man of sturdy muscular frame, swarthy
complexion, dark eyes, strong jaws, a man who would be a good friend or
a bad enemy. Johnson was older, tall and angular, with black bushy
hair, on whose lips shone no smile, under whose brow lurked treason,
stratagem, and spoil. I became acquainted with Johnson in a rather
romantic way, which you will excuse me for relating, as it shows some
of the perils and hardships incident to the settling of a new country.
On the 12th of November, 1842, a deep snow fell and remained till the
next April, with additions during the winter. It has always since been
called the hard winter of 1842 and '43.

During the winter my friend, Anderson Chambers, later a prosperous
business man of Muscatine, and I had been up in the country between the
Wapsipinicon and the Volga. The snow drifts were so deep and the day so
dark that night overtook us several hours ride from any human
habitation. Before dark we went into a little scattering timber on a
small stream and under the bluff hitched our horses to a bush. We found
some dry poles and got some dry rotten wood out of a tree, scraped away
the snow with our feet, and with the aid of a flint and some tow and
powder, we managed to start a little fire. Matches were not then in
use. We cut some brush and laid it on the ground, spread one horse
blanket on that to lie on, and with another to cover us and our saddles
for pillows, we slept through the long night until daylight, when we
resumed our ride. About the middle of the forenoon we came in sight of
an improvement in the edge of the timber, and I knew by the smoke that
so gracefully curled that a frontiersman's log cabin was there. We went
into the house, which was neat and clean, and told them of our hard
experience during the preceding night and day. They kindly sympathized
with us and soon made us comfortable. It proved to be Bill Johnson's
place. Kate Johnson and another young lady, Miss Kelso of Davenport,
were there. They busied themselves about setting us up a fresh, warm,
ten o'clock breakfast. I relished it more than any other breakfast I
ever ate, the zest of which was no doubt heightened by being served by
so charming a hostess, and me a susceptible bachelor, too.

Johnson explained his being there in this wild region by saying that he
had participated actively in the Canadian patriot war against the
Dominion of Canada, that the attempted revolution had failed, that he
had lost all his property by it, and had been driven and chased all
through and among the Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence river in his
boat with his daughter Kate, that a reward had been offered for him,
that he had given up all hope of success and determined to seek safety
and quietude by coming to this country. All this seemed plausible, as I
heard the brave deeds of the patriots rehearsed in song and poetry. But
in escaping that trouble he ran into the jaws of another at the outset.
It seemed that in coming into a strange neighborhood, instead of making
the people his friends by conciliation and prudent conduct, he got into
trouble at the start by taking possession of the claim of one of the
Bennett party. They remonstrated and he promised to pay for the claim,
but never did, though Johnson claimed that the trouble was about the
location of the county seat. Not long after I was at his place, after
giving him notice, they determined to oust him. They took him out in
the brush and gave him a very severe flogging, loaded him and all his
belongings into sleds and sent him out of the country. He applied for
aid at Marion and Dubuque, and Surveyor General Wilson, a New Hampshire
man, took him and his daughter Kate to Iowa City, in his fine Boston
made sleigh, to interest Governor Chambers in his behalf. When the
hostilities came to an end, the result was disastrous to both parties.
Bennett became a fugitive and his mill building was stopped. Johnson
was shot. Kate found her a loving, trusting husband. Hosea Gray made
considerable money out of it; Ormus Clark, the first permanent settler
of Central City, spent a lot of money for defense, and Colonel Preston
laid the foundation of his splendid fame and fortune as an attorney
from it.

The public land sales had been advertised for this winter and the
people were illy prepared to go to Dubuque to enter their claims on
account of the deep snow, some for scarcity of clothing, and all for
scarcity of money. Many had saved their last 12-1/2 and 6-1/2 cent
silver coins and their 5-franc pieces to make up the necessary sums. In
view of the difficulties in the way, a mass meeting was held, and
George Greene was appointed a special agent to go to Washington City
for the purpose of having the land office removed to Marion. He went
and saw the commissioner of public lands; he saw Stephen A. Douglas,
chairman of the committee on public lands, and President Tyler, and
came back with an order for the temporary removal in his pocket, which
I doubt if any other man could have done. He stood luminous among all
the bright men who first settled in Linn county, or the territory
either. The people of Linn county, and of Cedar Rapids especially,
should ever remember his labors and efforts in those early days which
brought them prominence and prosperity. All now acknowledge Linn county
to be without a peer and Cedar Rapids is the best interior city in the
state, except Des Moines with its immense coal beds.

The land office was located in the first, and then only brick house in
Marion. Judge Berry afterwards dispensed boundless hospitality in it.
It was built and owned by William H. Woodbridge, or "Democ Woodbridge,"
a very enterprising young man. He was one of five from this county who
enlisted in the Mexican war. He was with Scott's army of invasion and
the Mexicans "welcomed him with bloody hands to a hospitable grave."
Another of the five, Major McKean, as he was then known, who was a
member of the first constitutional convention in 1844, and later a
brigadier general in the union army, lies buried in the Marion
cemetery. Another of the five, Captain Sausman, who gallantly bore the
flag at Chepultepec, died in California. Captain Gray is alone, and
alive and likely to be, as you would think if you could see him running
an intricate surveyor's line through a section. The fifth one, Samuel
D. Thompson, is with us amply provided for in his declining years by a
munificent government, in recognition of his military service in nearly
all the wars since the time of Anthony Wayne, and as the old song says:

     "There is no more work for brave old Joe.
     He's gone to the place where all good soldiers go."

The land sales drew large numbers from all the surrounding country, and
made lively times here. Joseph F. Chapman and Oliver S. Hall, Sr.,
hotel keepers, flourished. Those who had the money got titles to their
lands, and those who had not still held their claims until such time as
they could enter them at private sale. In the spring the land office
was moved back to Dubuque.

In 1844 the first constitutional convention was held at Iowa City. The
constitution failed of ratification. In 1846 another convention was
held and the state fully admitted under that with our present
boundaries. Iowa was then the most western state, and a line drawn
south from Sioux City, its western limit, would have run further west
than any other state or territory, except Texas, which was annexed the
year before. It now occupies a conspicuous central position in the
American union, and a leading one in agricultural productions. It is
honored with two members of the president's cabinet and the most
influential member of the American senate.

After our acquisition of California the waves of emigration westward
began, sweeping over the great American desert, as it had been called,
planting agriculture and industry in its path, forcing its way through
the mountain passes and over the sun-dried plains, to the Pacific ocean
at the Golden Gate, where floats the commerce of oriental Asia.

     "No pent up Utica contracts our powers;
     The whole of this boundless domain is ours."

When I look in the faces of this multitude I see before me but few who
were men and women grown when I first came here. Some of you
gray-haired ladies and gentlemen were then, as the Indians called them,
petite squaws or skinneways. Your fathers were Niseshin Shomoko men.
But I think scarcely more than a dozen are now living in this county
who were then men and women. And

     "I feel like one who treads alone
       A banquet hall deserted,
     Whose music is hushed, whose guests are gone,
       And all but me departed."

CHAPTER XX

_Early Linn County Lawyers and Courts_

BY JUDGE MILO P. SMITH


Fifty years ago the judiciary of this county, as well as of the entire
country, was quite different from what it now is. There were but two
terms of court in a county, and Linn being a large county, terms here
lasted about two or three weeks. In the smaller counties, one week or
less was sufficient for the transaction of all the business. The grand
jury was composed of fifteen men instead of five or seven, as at
present, and twelve out of the fifteen had to concur in order to find a
bill of indictment. At present the concurrence of a less number than
the whole is sufficient. The members of the grand jury selected their
own clerk from their own number. They had no authority to act on the
minutes of the examining magistrate, but it was obligatory on them to
have the witnesses before them, and to examine them personally.

There was no official shorthand reporter to take down the evidence on
the trial of cases in court. If the attorneys desired to perpetuate the
testimony, or any part of it, they either wrote it down in long hand
themselves, or selected some outside person to do it; generally some
young lawyer. And sometimes the judge would make the only minutes of
the trial that were kept. From these imperfect notes, however taken,
the judge was required to determine what should go to the supreme court
when he came to settle the bill of exceptions: no easy task. When court
opened on the first day of the term--which was done with great
outcry--the judge at once empaneled the grand jury, and then proceeded
to make what was called a "preliminary" call of the calendar, at which
cases that were not for trial were dismissed, continued, marked
settled, or otherwise disposed of. When that call was completed, he
then made the "peremptory" call, and all cases that were for trial were
then disposed of as they were reached. There was no assignment of cases
for trial as now practiced, but the lawyers had to be ready in each
case when reached.

Court week was generally regarded by the people as a sort of a picnic
or holiday, and they came in from the country for several miles around
to hear the lawyers spar with each other, and catch the "rulings of the
court." The court room was generally packed with listeners. Then
political meetings were generally held during that week when everybody
was there and lawyers ready to do the speaking; and they furnished fine
entertainments indeed.

The bar of Linn county in the early fifties was an unusually strong
one, said by some to be the strongest in the state. There were Judge N.
W. Isbell, Judge Isaac Cook, Judge George Greene, Judge William Smyth,
and Col. I. M. Preston. A little in the rear of the above worthies were
N. M. Hubbard, R. D. Stephens, Wm. G. Thompson, J. H. Young, Thomas
Corbett, and J. W. Dudley. Except Judge Greene and J. W. Dudley, all of
these persons lived in Marion.

N. W. Isbell, the first county judge in this county, was selected by
the legislature in 1855 as a member of the supreme court, and filled
the position with honor and credit to himself and the state for several
years, and was afterwards appointed judge of the district court during
the Civil war, but resigned both positions on account of ill health. He
was a very learned man and a profound lawyer. He greatly enjoyed the
investigation of legal questions, possessed an acute and analytical
mind, and one richly stored with the results of historical and general
reading. In the practice he was not partial to jury trials, much
preferring the presentation of legal questions to the court. He had
quite an aptitude for affairs, and became successful as an enterprising
railroad builder, projecting the old "Air Line" Railroad, the pioneer
of the present route of the C., M. & St. P. Railway across the state.
He left a comfortable estate to his family, dying about the year 1865.
He was of small stature and insignificant in appearance, but with a
large head, though small features. Indeed he very much resembled the
Hon. Wm. H. Seward in face, head, and stature. He was rather of an
irascible temperament and consequently easily thrown off his
balance--but no member of the bar was more highly respected than was
Judge Isbell for uprightness, honesty of purpose, general intelligence,
deep reading in general literature as well as in the law; and his
blameless life made him a beloved citizen.

I omit further mention of Judge Greene as there is elsewhere in this
work a lengthy sketch of him.

Isaac Cook was born and raised in eastern Pennsylvania and became the
possessor of a sound education as a basis for the legal studies he
afterward pursued. He served quite a while on the district bench, and
was there noted for the care, time, and fairness he devoted to the
cases he was called on to hear and decide. His mind was not so quick or
rapid in its movements as some others, but it was very accurate in its
conclusions. He was a fine chancery and corporation lawyer, and no
better pleader ever drew a petition than Judge Cook. He was for many
years toward the close of his life general counsel for the predecessors
of the C. & N. W. Railway Company and the Iowa Railroad Land Company in
the state of Iowa. Though he had an office first in Marion and then in
Cedar Rapids, he always lived on his farm just south of the former
place, in a plain, comfortable brick house. He was a broad shouldered,
stock-built man of a dark complexion, and chewed an immense quantity of
tobacco. He had, we believe, more practice in the supreme court of the
United States than any other lawyer in Iowa in his day.

William Smyth, first county attorney of Linn county, was appointed
judge of the district court to succeed Judge J. P. Carleton about the
year 1854, when he was but thirty years of age. He was regarded as an
ideal judge. He was of Scotch-Irish descent, and had received a
thorough education when young. His education was perhaps more thorough
than broad, owing no doubt to his early surroundings. His legal lore
was as near exact and profound as was possible, and covered completely
the whole circle of legal learning. One who knew him well said, that in
commercial law, the law of real estate, and in pleading, he had no
superiors and but few equals in the state. He was a trial lawyer in the
fullest sense of that term. Careful in the preparation of his cases,
methodical in the introduction of his testimony; and in his
presentation of his client's cause to a jury, his arguments were close
and convincing, logical if not eloquent. He was, perhaps, after his
retirement from the district bench, generally regarded as the head of
the bar of the county. His knowledge of the affairs of the nation, and
the principles of our government was most exact and comprehensive. For
wealth of general information, profundity of legal learning, and
urbanity of manner and dignity of deportment, he was not surpassed by
any man in the state. Indeed he was early recognized as one of the
leaders in affairs as well as of the bar of the state. He and the firm
of which he was a member had the largest practice and the best
clientage in the county. His practice extended to many of the
neighboring counties, such as Benton, Tama, and Iowa, where he had
local partners, and where he attended the terms of court. He was a
valuable member of the committee that revised the laws of the state as
embodied in the Revision of 1860. He was offered a place on the supreme
court bench but declined it. He was a delegate to the Republican
National Convention at Chicago in 1860--having been a democrat before
the slavery question gave rise to the republican party, he naturally
sided with Governor Chase, whose political path led in the same
direction as his own, and gave that statesman his earnest and
persistent support in the convention, voting for him to the last as his
choice for president. He was a formidable competitor of Governor James
W. Grimes when the latter was elected to the United States senate in
1858. In 1868 he was elected to congress from this district and died
while such member in 1870, at the early age of forty-six. Of all that
goes to make up a first rate man and citizen--intelligence, ability,
industry, perseverance, honesty, and morality, he was in full
possession, and enjoyed the confidence of the people to a greater
degree than any other citizen in the county. He was patriotic and brave
and served during the war of the rebellion as colonel of an Iowa
regiment, and while so serving, he contracted the disease that caused
his early death. He was the fortunate possessor of a splendid frame,
being nearly six feet in height, and had a large, well formed head--his
carriage erect and movements stately and deliberate. He was a model
christian gentleman, courtly and polite, with a winning personality. He
too was a man of affairs and left a comfortable estate to his family.

Colonel I. M. Preston, born in 1813, was in many respects a remarkable
man. Thrown on his own resources when quite young, he learned the trade
of carpenter and joiner, but read law while working at his trade, was
admitted when about thirty years of age, came to Marion, opened an
office, and at once took a position in the front rank of trial lawyers.
He was particularly successful as a criminal lawyer. He possessed a
very quick, subtle, and keen mind, and was remarkably resourceful in
expedients in the trial of cases. Some lawyers were better pleaders
others more learned in the law, but none more apt in furnishing the
facts to fit the case, and but few, if any, excelled him in marshalling
those facts in his presentation to the jury. In time he acquired great
fame throughout the state as a lawyer and public speaker. He was early
appointed district attorney for the district in which he lived, and in
1846 was commissioned by Governor Clark colonel of an Iowa regiment of
militia. He also served as county judge of Linn county, and at
different times served in both branches of the legislature. He was the
father of Judge J. H. Preston and E. C. Preston, both members of the
bar, and residents of the city of Cedar Rapids.

N. M. Hubbard, later known as Judge Hubbard, was certainly the most
brilliant and noted lawyer that ever lived in or graced the bar of this
county. He was appointed in 1865 judge of the district court, and
served till January 1, 1867. With a mind keen, bright and luminous, a
sound understanding, a rich store of observation, an unparalleled
command of language, a readiness in repartee, and unlimited power of
invective, he was unsurpassed by any man in the state, and by but few
in the nation. He was for thirty years general attorney for the C. & N.
W. Railway Company in Iowa, and upon his death left a generous estate.

Hubbard's early partner, R. D. Stephens, while a good lawyer, was
certainly a past master in finance, and was better known as a banker
than lawyer. He established the First National Bank at Marion, and the
Merchants National Bank in Cedar Rapids. He died several years ago,
quite wealthy. Both Hubbard and Stephens came to Linn county from the
state of New York in 1854. In the political campaign of 1856, Hubbard
edited the _Linn County Register_, predecessor to the _Marion
Register_.

Major J. B. Young was probably the possessor of the best education of
any of the lawyers of his time, and was a well read lawyer, a strong
advocate, careful and painstaking, but unfortunately possessed an
irritableness and quickness of temper that was not calculated to
advance the cause of his client in a law suit. He died when
comparatively young, when on his way home from California where he had
gone on account of his failing health.

W. G. Thompson, better known as Major Thompson or Judge Thompson, still
resides here at the ripe old age of eighty-one. But few of the present
generation know all there is about Judge Thompson. Born and reared in
the state of Pennsylvania of Scotch parentage, with a fair academical
education, admitted to the bar when a little past twenty-one, he came
to Linn county in 1853, and at once leaped into prominence as a lawyer
and politician. In quickness of mind, versatility in extremity,
readiness of retort, flashings of wit, volubility of speech, touches of
pathos, flights of eloquence, and geniality of disposition, and
popularity with the masses, he had no superior in eastern Iowa, if he
had an equal. It has been said of him that he could sit down to a trial
table in a case of which he had never before heard, and try it just as
well as though he had had months of preparation. He has been county
attorney, state senator, presidential elector, major of the Twentieth
Iowa Volunteer Infantry, district attorney, chief justice of Idaho,
member of the legislature, member of congress, and judge of the
district court. And in filling all of these positions, he has served
the people faithfully and well. And in private life and as a
practitioner he has surely been "a man without a model and without a
shadow."

J. W. Dudley lived in Cedar Rapids as Thomas Corbett did in Marion.
They were both careful, pains-taking, and judicious lawyers, not
particularly noted in any special respect, but safe, sound, and
trustworthy. They have both been long since dead.

J. J. Child and I. N. Whittam were also members of the bar in the early
'50s. They both lived in Cedar Rapids. Judge Whittam was noted for his
industry, care and patience in regard to any matter in which he became
engaged. He did not claim to be a man of mark or a great lawyer, but
certainly acquired and retained the confidence as an advisor of many of
the best citizens in Cedar Rapids and vicinity.

J. J. Child, long since dead, was said by those who knew him best to be
one of the best lawyers in the state. Though not an advocate, his
learning in law was wide and deep, and no client ever made a mistake in
following his advice. Unfortunately his habits of life seriously
impeded the good results that could have flowed from such a prolific
source.

After these, came others to fill their places, but the most of them are
here now, and have received special reference and personal mention in
these pages.

The entire state in 1857 was divided into twelve judicial districts,
with one judge in each district. Accompanying the act was the
constitutional provision that new districts could not be created
oftener than one new district in four years. Within about ten years the
business in court became so congested that relief was necessary and was
sought in all directions. Finally, in 1868, the legislature passed a
circuit court bill, which by its terms divided every district into two
circuits and provided a judge for each circuit. The circuit court had
concurrent jurisdiction with the district court in all cases at law and
in equity, and sole jurisdiction in probate matters and in appeals from
justices of the peace, but it did not have jurisdiction in criminal
cases. The same legislature abolished the county court that formerly
had jurisdiction of probate matters. In further defining the duties and
powers of this court, the law created what was called a general term,
to which all appeals from, and application for the correction of errors
by the district and circuit courts would lie. The personnel of that
court consisted of the judge of the district and the two circuit
judges, and it sat twice a year. In this district one of the sessions
was held in Marion and the other in Iowa City. The district comprised
the counties of Jones, Cedar, Linn, Johnson, Benton, Iowa, and Tama.
The first three counties constituted one circuit, and the latter four
the other one. The limitation of the right to appeal when the amount in
controversy was less than one hundred dollars was then passed. An
appeal finally lay from the decision to the general term of the supreme
court. When a case was decided at the general term, the judge to whom
it was referred for a decision wrote out the decision in an opinion as
the supreme court judges do, but the opinions were not reported in the
books.

[Illustration: PUBLIC SCHOOL AT SPRINGVILLE]

The next legislature materially changed the law. It abolished the
general term and consolidated the two circuits, cutting out one of the
judges--each court retaining the jurisdiction it had--and provided for
appeals directly to the supreme court.

Then in 1886, the constitution of the state was radically changed by a
vote of the people so that the limitation on the number of judicial
districts and number of judges was removed. The circuit court was
abolished, the office of district attorney was abolished, and that of
county attorney created. There was a prosecuting attorney for each
district before. The legislature then created as many districts as was
thought necessary, and as many judges to a district as were deemed
sufficient to transact the business. This law is still in force. This
became the new eighteenth judicial district, composed of the counties
of Linn, Cedar, and Jones, with three judges.

The first district judge for Linn county after the adoption of the new
constitution in 1857, was Hon. William E. Miller, of Iowa City, and
Isaac L. Allen, of Toledo, was elected district attorney--this in 1858.
Allen was afterwards attorney general of the state.

Judge Miller was well equipped for the position. With a thorough common
school education, and having been a practical machinist when young, and
with strong common sense, he had a naturally good judicial mind that
had been improved by careful study and years of practice in the law. He
came to the bench an intelligent, fair, and courteous judge. He
resigned in 1862 and entered the Union army as colonel of the
Twenty-eighth Iowa Volunteer Infantry. He afterwards served as circuit
judge and finally as supreme judge of the state. From the resignation
of Judge Miller till January 1, 1867, the district bench was graced in
its occupancy by Judge N. W. Isbell, C. H. Conklin, and N. M. Hubbard.

Judge Miller was a broad-shouldered, short, squatty fellow, and though
a good lawyer and jurist, he was an indifferent advocate, and not
particularly strong as a trial lawyer.

Judge Conklin was probably the most scholarly, accomplished and
profound lawyer that ever sat on the district bench in this part of the
state. His home was in Vinton, and while he lived among the people
there he did not seem to be of them. He was a strong, tall, raw-boned
man, always carefully dressed, with a most marked intellectual face,
and he was certainly one of the most eloquent advocates that ever stood
before a jury in eastern Iowa.

Judge James H. Rothrock, of Tipton, was elected judge in 1866, and
served on the district bench till in February, 1876, when he was, by
the governor, appointed to a seat on the supreme bench, which position
he filled for over twenty years, when he voluntarily declined a further
renomination. He, too, entered the Union army in 1862 as lieutenant
colonel of the Thirty-fifth Iowa Volunteer Infantry, and served with
credit till sickness compelled him to resign and come home. Judge
Rothrock was not a learned man in the sense of having a college
education or having possessed an extensive breadth of general reading
in history or science, nor was he fluent of speech, or particularly
adroit as a practitioner, but he possessed naturally good judgment, a
most thorough common English education, a good knowledge of the law and
its basic principles, a sound understanding, with an innate sense of
justice. He was patient and even tempered, dignified, and kind. He made
a splendid _nisi prius_ judge. His opinions were always plain, couched
in good strong Anglo-Saxon, terse and sound, and will long bear the
close and sharp criticism of posterity. Whenever he announced a
principle of law, it was accepted without dispute as the law on the
point involved. Judge Rothrock was a large man of fine physique,
impressible presence, and very genial when off the bench.

The Hon. John Shane, of Vinton, succeeded Judge Rothrock on the bench
of this district in 1876 and served till 1882, when he resigned on
account of ill health. He possessed a much better education than did
Judge Rothrock, and the scope of his general reading was not only
broad, but judiciously directed. He loved the law for the very sake of
it and never tired of investigating its ofttimes hidden mysteries. He
was well liked as a judge, was convivial and sociable to a degree.

The judges who have filled the position on the district bench since
Judge Shane's retirement are many and able, but can scarcely be said to
belong to the olden time.

Of the few circuit judges that held court in this county, we can say
that they graced the position they filled with ease, but they belong
rather to the present time than to the past age. But Judges Yates,
McKean, and Hedges will long be remembered by the older inhabitants as
capable, learned, and upright judges.

In the palmy days of the lawyers and judges described, the law
libraries were meagre and the books few. There are probably now a dozen
law libraries in the county, any one of which contains more books than
were in the county in 1860, and there are some that contain twice or
three times as many. The practicing attorney was then thrown more upon
his own resources, and compelled to depend more on his own power of
analysis and discrimination than at the present time, which doubtless
made them stronger, more self-reliant, and resourceful. And the judges
were called upon to decide rather how the law should be than how it had
been pronounced to be by some other tribunal, which was no doubt
strengthening to them.




CHAPTER XXI

_Chatty Mention of Bench and Bar_


The history of any community is not complete without a sketch of the
members of the bar, for in the Temple of Justice every phase of human
life is seen. "Here one hears the cry for vengeance and also the kind
pleadings for mercy." The members of the bar, especially in the early
day, understood public opinion and discovered what men truly were and
not what they were reputed to be. At this early day the lawyers were
the tribunes of the people. They were men of brilliant intellect and of
intense passions, and in trials which created universal interest in the
sparsely settled community they swayed the minds and hearts of their
hearers in a remarkable degree. It was an age of oratory, and Linn
county in that day had its quota of brilliant intellects who remained
here for a shorter or longer period of time and in no small degree
assisted in the upbuilding of the county and the state.

In order to make this sketch as brief as possible, and in an endeavor
to picture the men as they were, we shall attempt to give a little of
the humorous side of their characters and follow in the footsteps of
Channing who said "anecdotes are worth pages of biographies."

Many of the early members of the bar were men of education and
refinement, possessing a snappy humor that set courts and juries
roaring. Many a long day's trial was brightened by some sally of native
wit fresh from the frontier. These men were active in politics, were
promoters of steamboat lines, stage companies, and paper railroads,
who, in course of time, became legislatures, judges, and financiers.
They all labored for the upbuilding of the infant state, where they had
invested all their surplus means, having faith in Iowa's future. In
every way possible they tried to upbuild its infant industries.

Linn county was set off by act of legislature in 1837, while Iowa was
then a part of Wisconsin Territory. In August Governor Lucas set off
Johnson, Cedar, Jones and Linn counties in one legislative district.
The attorneys from Linn county who appeared at Iowa City at the July
term, A. D. 1847, were Isaac M. Preston, John David and William Smythe,
all of whom became noted lawyers before that body later. The judges on
the bench at this time were three well known Iowa jurists: Williams,
Wilson, and Kinney.

The first court was held at Marion October 26, 1840, presided over by
Joseph Williams, who had been appointed to the judgeship July 25, 1838.
At this term of court, according to the records, there were present
District Attorney W. G. Woodward for the federal government, R. P.
Lowe, prosecuting attorney, H. W. Gray, sheriff, T. H. Tryon, clerk,
and L. Mallory, marshal of the district. On the first grand jury sat
Israel Mitchell, founder of Westport, who had been appointed probate
judge on January 16 of the previous year. The first justices in the
county were: H. B. Burnap, John G. Cole, John M. Afferty, John Crow,
William Abbe, and Israel Mitchell. Some of the first county judges
were: Norman Isbell, Dan Lothian, J. Elliott, A. H. Dumont, and J. M.
Berry.

During these early days there were two terms of court, one in January,
and the other in June. The cases brought involved small amounts, but
for the number of inhabitants of the county there was a great deal more
litigation then than now. Some of the early lawyers in Marion and Cedar
Rapids were: I. M. Preston, J. E. Sanford, N. W. Isbell, Isaac Cook,
Henry Harman, William Smyth, J. J. Child, Joe B. Young, Dan Lothian,
C. M. Hollis, J. David. N. M. Hubbard, R. D. Stephens, Tom Corbett,
George Greene, Israel Mitchell, D. O. Finch, A. S. Belt, John Mitchell,
G. A. Gray, and C. L. Murray.

Among the attorneys in practice during the early '50s in Cedar Rapids
were the following: Henry Lehman, E. M. Bates, C. V. Tousley, J. J.
Child, R. G. Welcher, D. M. McIntosh, T. J. Dudley, Jr., A. Sidney
Belt, and Dan O. Finch, the latter being also editor of the
_Progressive Era_. In 1861 came J. Munger and N. R. Graham, and during
the next year Edward Stark, who formed a partnership with A. S. Belt.
In 1862 came W. A. Dodge. During the early '60s George Greene and I. M.
Preston were in partnership, Greene having an office in Cedar Rapids
and Preston in Marion. Hubbard and Stephens were in partnership in
Marion in the early '60s, Stephens running the law business while
Hubbard went to "the front."

The attorneys locating here in the '50s and '60s were engaged in
railway promotion, in politics, and in booming towns, although they did
not neglect banking and fire insurance. There were towns which had two
or three lawyers in the early day which have none now, which would
indicate that litigation in the early days was more profitable than
later. In conversation with a number of the old lawyers this has been
told, that the land business was the best paying law business during
the pioneer days. It is also stated that much of the litigation in the
early days was to defend horse thieves and other criminals. How true
this is the writer does not know.

In the early days there was a class of people called "Terrorists"
causing the settlers much annoyance and trouble. They were a band of
looters who came along to scare people by reporting threatened Indian
attacks, and when the settlers had fled to a place of safety others of
the band came along and looted the abandoned houses. The "Copperhead"
movement also extended into this county during the early period of the
war, and more or less litigation grew out of this excitement.

Among some of the well known lawyers of the pioneer days of this county
who have played a more or less prominent part at the bar, in politics,
and otherwise, may be mentioned John David and J. E. Sanford, who came
to Iowa in 1840. They were both bright men and had an exceptionally
large practice in land titles. Any examiner of abstracts in this county
will find Sanford's name frequently as holding much of this land, also
that of H. W. Sanford, a relative. Thomas Corbett came from the east in
an early day, was one of the characters at Marion, and became a well
known attorney, removing from Iowa in a short time on account of his
health. He became a hero soon after he married a well known lady in
Marion whose people were well to do. As Corbett had nothing but brains
for assets, one of the brothers of the bride did not like this marriage
and came to the house of a friend just after the wedding with a party
of young fellows to horsewhip the groom, who was not a very large man,
but an active one. The groom was not at all backward about meeting his
antagonist and gave him a thrashing to such an extent that he had no
cause to forget it very soon, much to the enjoyment of the crowd who
all took Corbett's side. It was not long until Corbett displayed great
ability as an attorney, and became financially successful as well.

Norman W. Isbell located in Marion in 1842, being a native of Ohio. He
served as county judge, in which position he rendered excellent
service. In politics he was a whig, but when the slavery issue sent
that neutral party out of existence, Judge Isbell became a republican.
In 1854 he became a partner of N. M. Hubbard, which partnership
continued up to about 1860, with the exception of the time when he held
office. In 1855 he was elected supreme judge of the state, resigning in
1856 on account of failing health. In September, 1862, upon the
resignation of Judge William E. Miller, Governor Kirkwood appointed
Judge Isbell to fill the vacancy on the supreme bench. He was elected
at the expiration of the term, but resigned in 1864, removing to
California on account of illness, where he died of consumption the
following year at the age of forty-six. All the members of the bar
proclaim Judge Isbell one of the keenest lawyers who ever practiced in
this county, at least in that day. His applications of legal principles
were sound and his illustrations apt and catchy. He was not a great
jury lawyer in the true sense of the word, and perhaps not as well
known among the masses as many others, but among the legal fraternity
Judge Isbell was looked up to as a safe lawyer and most excellent
judge, who by hard study had attained to high rank among the jurists of
this state. His son, N. G. Isbell, practiced a short time here, but
removed to Michigan where he died many years ago, before reaching
middle age.

[Illustration: HOME OF J. F. BUTLER, SPRINGVILLE]

Another lawyer of much ability and universally respected was Isaac
Cook, a native of Chester county, Pennsylvania, who located in Palmyra,
Missouri, in 1844, and later practiced law in Dubuque, and also in
Marion, removing to Cedar Rapids in 1848. He was elected to the bench
in 1857. Judge Cook was of a quiet turn of mind, a man who never gave a
sidewalk advice which he had to take back. He was elected the first
city attorney in Cedar Rapids in 1850, and was tendered a banquet upon
his resignation from the bench in 1858. He was also the first president
of a republican club organized in Linn county. Judge Cook died in 1878,
honored and respected by all who knew him.

John Mitchell came from Maine in 1853, entered Judge Isbell's office,
and was admitted to the bar in 1857. He was later a partner of Judge
Smythe and Judge Lothian. Mitchell died a few years ago, one of the
oldest practitioners in the county.

R. D. Stephens was born in New York in 1829, and came to Marion in 1855
without means, but with a splendid training and with a lively interest
for business. He entered the law office of Isbell & Hubbard, later
becoming a partner of Judge Hubbard. Mr. Stephens at an early date
became interested in politics, and later became famous as a commercial
lawyer and financier. He died in Cedar Rapids as president of the
Merchants National Bank, and was rated one of the wealthiest men in the
county. His son, R. D. Stephens. Jr., is now a practicing attorney in
Chicago.

Joe B. Young was born in 1832 in Pennsylvania, and was admitted to the
bar at Iowa City in 1853. He located in Marion and was prosecuting
attorney in Linn county, a member of the legislature, and later a
member of the state senate, and for a time pension agent for the state
of Iowa. Joe Young was cross and crabbed in the court, frequently
opposed the judge, as well as the opposing counsel, and displayed on
many occasions bad temper, not to such an extent, however, that he ever
lost sight of his client's interest or his case. He was a stubborn
legal fighter and was recognized as a great lawyer who never gave up
until he had exhausted all his resources. He died in 1876, one of the
best known attorneys in eastern Iowa, universally acknowledged the
greatest wit and the most sarcastic in retort of any man who practiced
at the bar. He saw only one side of a case and that was his side and he
always maintained that, backed up by proof, there was no other side.
Even in church matters he differed with the majority, and organized a
new church, paying for it himself, so as to have things his own way. He
was a most signal man in his profession, always a student, and seemed
to know everything which would likely reveal where motives start and
where the secret springs of conscience were in a long drawn out law
suit.

D. M. McIntosh was a native of South Carolina, and located in Cedar
Rapids in the '40s. He was small of stature, with a ruddy face and long
hair, making an imposing figure in the court room. He possessed
considerable legal ability, had many friends, and was one of the best
known men in Cedar Rapids. He died in 1859, mourned by a large circle
of friends, who for years remembered how this brilliant son of the
south had on many occasions lighted up the dull path of the law with a
glow of fancy and spiced his remarks by the charm of frontier oratory.

Colonel J. M. May was another attorney who was well known in Cedar
Rapids, and who located here at an early date, and after him May's
Island is named. He was erratic and wasted a large fortune in
litigation with his relatives and neighbors over rights of various
kinds. He died in Cedar Rapids a short time ago.

I. N. Whittam was another of the pioneer lawyers who died a few years
ago, having located in Cedar Rapids in 1854. He assisted Judge Greene
in getting out "Greene's Reports of Iowa." He was in continuous
practice up to the time of his death.

Ellsworth N. Bates, coming to Linn county in the early fifties, was
quickly known as the silver tongued orator of the Cedar Valley. He was
the first city attorney, appointed in 1856, at $20.00 a year. He served
till 1860. Mr. Bates won fame and honor as a lawyer and editor, and
being a person of tact and force of character, he won many friends. His
glowing tribute to the men who built the railway, at the June
celebration in 1859, gave him prestige as a great orator. Mr. Bates
enlisted in the Civil war and died from exposure a short time
afterwards.

George Greene, who died in 1880 at the age of sixty-three, was one of
the best known men in Iowa at the time of his death. Born in England,
Mr. Greene educated himself in Buffalo, studying with George P. Baker.
In 1838 he came to Davenport and began to make a geological survey of
Iowa. After he had worked for six months at this kind of work, which
was not at all congenial, he located in Ivanhoe, Linn county, and
taught the first term of school in that vicinity. In 1840 he was
admitted to the bar at Iowa City, locating later at Marion, where he
began the practice of law. The next year he was sent to the
legislature. Here he became acquainted with the prominent men of the
state, and as the law business was not flourishing he removed in 1845
to Dubuque, and while nominally in the practice he became editor of the
_Miner's Express_, which was then one of the nourishing papers of the
territory. Three years later he formed a partnership for the practice
of law with J. J. Dyer. In October, 1847, Judge Wilson resigned his
office of associate justice and the governor filled the vacancy by
appointing George Greene, who from that day to the day of his death
became a figure of importance in politics as well as in financial
affairs in Iowa. Judge Greene was a man of marked ability, having had
excellent opportunities and being possessed of untiring industry. In
1848 he was elected one of the supreme court judges by the joint vote
of the two houses of the General Assembly and served for six years from
January 15, 1849. During his term of office he reported the decisions
of the court. These decisions were published in four volumes and are
known as "Greene's Reports of Iowa." In 1851 Judge Greene removed to
Cedar Rapids, where he engaged in banking and where he was one of the
most active citizens in persuading manufacturers to come to this city.
He was instrumental in securing the Chicago & Northwestern, and the
Burlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern Railways to pass through Cedar
Rapids. In politics Judge Greene was a democrat until the Greely
campaign, when he became a republican. Few, if any, have done so much
among the early settlers in securing capital to be invested in Iowa.
Judge Greene travelled much and personally knew many financiers in this
country and in England, many of whom invested much funds in farm lands,
town lots, in bonds, and stocks, in Linn and adjoining counties. After
locating in Cedar Rapids Judge Greene had a number of partners. While
he, himself, did not devote himself actively to the law business, the
firm generally had a large practice. He was in partnership with Judge
Hubbard, Cyrus Benley, A. S. Belt, and with Judge Dudley.

A. Sidney Belt was a southerner by birth, a person of much ability, of
engaging manners, and well known in his day throughout Linn and
adjoining counties.

Colonel Isaac M. Preston was born in Bennington, Vermont, in 1813, the
son of a revolutionary soldier. He learned the trade of cabinet-making.
At an early age he drifted west, remained for awhile in Ohio, and
finally located in Marion in 1842, where he began the practice of law.
Three years later he was appointed district attorney, serving two
years. In February, 1846, he was commissioned colonel to organize
troops for the Mexican war. He served as probate judge of Linn county
for four years. He was appointed by President Polk, United States
attorney for Iowa in 1847. In 1850 he was elected to the house of the
Third General Assembly, and after serving one term was elected to the
state senate where, during four years in the Fourth and Fifth General
Assemblies, he was one of the most prominent legislators of that body
and took an active part in the enactment of the Code of 1851. Colonel
Preston had more litigation in his day and generation than any one
person in this and adjoining counties. He was strong before a court,
tactful and invincible before a jury, and especially in the defense of
criminal cases he had no superior. The bar of Linn county during the
early days was one of the strongest in the state, and Colonel Preston
during his long and active practice before the supreme court, held a
high place and was recognized as one of the leading attorneys of
eastern Iowa, a position to which he early attained and which he
continuously held up to the time of his death.

William Smythe was born in Tyrone county, Ireland, in 1824. He
emigrated with his parents at the age of fifteen to America and located
in Linn county in 1840. He studied law at Iowa City, and in 1848 opened
an office in Marion. In 1853 he was appointed judge of the fourth
judicial district, serving four years. In 1858 he was chosen by the
Seventh General Assembly one of the three commissioners to revise and
codify the laws of the state. This work was accepted by the legislature
and became what is known as the "Code of 1860." Judge Smythe was also
appointed upon a commission of legal inquiry, and was one of the
commissioners to negotiate bonds by the state to provide a war defense
fund. He served two years in the army as colonel of the Thirty-first
Iowa Infantry. In politics Judge Smythe was a republican, and from the
beginning of his legal career he took more or less interest in
politics. In 1868 he and Judge Hubbard were the republican candidates
for congress, a campaign which was waged with much bitterness, so much
so that friend turned against friend and neighbor against neighbor. It
is said that a few days after Hubbard's defeat he met a shoe-maker on
the street who had been a former friend but who had been persuaded to
vote for Smythe, and Hubbard said to him, "Jack, you will not need to
buy any bristles any more, just reach your hand over your shoulder and
you can pull them out of your back, for there is nothing about you but
a hog anyway."

After Judge Smythe's nomination William Leffingwell was put up by the
democrats to beat him, Leffingwell being one of the noted orators of
the state, but Judge Smythe was victorious. He attained to a high place
as lawyer and as a constructive statesman. He possessed a profound
intellect, was popular among the masses, and a just and honorable man.
He passed away when he had just reached middle life, one of the ablest
and most versatile men in Linn county at the time of his untimely
death.

Judge N. M. Hubbard, who was a unique character and one of the best
known men in Iowa for many years, was born in Oswego, New York, in
1829, the son of a Methodist minister. He was reared on a farm and
began life as a blacksmith, although later he obtained a university
education. Judge Hubbard located in Marion for the practice of his
profession in 1854, later removing to Cedar Rapids. In February, 1856,
he was a delegate to the state convention which met at Iowa City, where
he helped to organize the republican party. During the war he assisted
in organizing the Twentieth Iowa Volunteer Infantry, in which he was
chosen a captain, serving under General F. J. Herron. In March, 1863,
he was promoted to judge advocate and served in the army until he was
breveted major in 1865. This year he was appointed district judge,
resigning after having served a year, to accept the position of general
attorney for the Northwestern railroad in the state of Iowa.

The sayings of Judge Hubbard would fill a book of many pages, but many
of them would need to be sterilized before put into type. Many of these
witty remarks are still repeated during a lull in the court room when
stories take the place of dry facts. He was truly an original
character, not only as a political manager of a great political party,
but as railway counsel, and as a person who filled a large place in the
political arena of Iowa for many years. A few of these sayings may give
the reader an idea of the man as he really appeared during these years
of his political and legal career in Iowa.

At one time being asked how a new assistant behaved who had been
appointed local attorney for the railroad of which Hubbard had charge,
he replied, "Tim is a real bull in a china shop; what he don't smash he
dirties."

Speaking at one time of a technical lawyer, he added, "here is my
friend J, he is so technical that he will fall all over a crowbar to
hunt for a pin and not even see the crowbar, mind you."

While judge on the bench, some pompous doctor who was a witness asked
leave to go home to look after his patients, and the judge quietly
replied. "You had better stay here so as to give your patients a chance
to get well."

At another time an attorney who had formerly been governor got the
worst of it in Hubbard's court, and he appealed to him as a man and
friend, saying that the judge evidently must have forgotten that he
held his position due to his appointment while governor. Judge Hubbard
coolly replied, "Yes, I remember that very well as being the only
decent act of your term of office," and went on ruling against him as
he had before.

On a hot June day Hubbard was trying a case against John Weare, one of
the old pioneer bankers of this county. There was a lull in the
proceedings, and as the jury was walking out of the court room Weare
pulled out a large red handkerchief to wipe the sweat from his brow,
when Hubbard in his peculiar articulation, for which he was noted,
piped out, "John, it makes you sweat to tell the truth, don't it?" The
crowd laughed, and the cutting sarcasm was never forgotten or forgiven
by the aged banker, who was at the mercy of his old antagonist.

During one of the many political campaigns a Des Moines paper accused
Hubbard of giving away five hundred tickets to delegates. He was asked
by a friend about this and Hubbard replied. "That is a lie, I gave away
eleven hundred tickets this year, that is all."

During the Parrott fight for the governorship of Iowa, Hubbard at first
supported his old friend, but when he saw the turn affairs were taking
he suggested that Parrott withdraw, but the candidate refused, adding
that he had so many delegates pledged, and furthermore felt that he had
Providence on his side. Hubbard simply replied, "Well, you can take to
Providence and I will take to Shaw."

While arguing a case before the supreme court, the opposing counsel had
pounded the table a great deal during his lengthy argument. When he
concluded, Judge Hubbard arose to reply in the following little speech:
"I am strong. I can pound this oak table to pieces for I have been a
blacksmith in my time, and I will pound this table into splinters if
you say and if it will help me to win this suit." He went on in this
manner until the members of the court laughed, and even the opposing
counsel saw the ridiculousness of his performance.

[Illustration: METHODIST CHURCH, PALO]

[Illustration: SCENE AT SPRINGVILLE]

During one of his last appearances in court he was called by the
opposing counsel an "old mossback who might have been a great lawyer,
but that was many years ago." When the lawyer concluded all eyes were
turned on the old judge. As he arose to reply he said: "True. I am old
and not what I used to be, and I suppose I am fast getting to be an old
mossback." Then he went on telling of the old lawyers he had known at
the bar in Iowa in the early day. He spoke of the methods of the old
advocates, and of their bitter political fights, then added, "They
never tried to bolster up a witness, defraud an antagonist, or
blackmail a client as they do now, and if the real up-to-date lawyer
must do such a thing in order to become great and prominent, then I
thank God I am an old fogy of a lawyer and belong to the former
generation."

Judge Hubbard at one time abused Bill Harper most unmercifully in a
suit, and Bill Harper threatened that he would maul Hubbard into a dish
of jelly at sight. The judge one day appeared in court shortly after
the trouble, when Major Thompson said, "Judge, Bill Harper is looking
for you." The judge looked around, for he feared Harper, and not seeing
him, replied in somewhat of a gusto, "I saw him in the park and if he
had done anything to me, he would never have been Bill Harper at all,
he would have been dead."

At another time while the judge was defending a railroad company in a
damage suit involving a large amount of money a colored man had sworn
positively to facts in a case which everyone thought he knew nothing
about. In the trial of the case the judge turned to an old friend, and
a "Copperhead," saying, "I am glad there are some Copperheads here; I
fought to free the nigger. I stood up to be shot at, now, by gosh, I am
a Copperhead. A man who will swear in court like that nigger did today
ought to be a slave and should never be free."

Judge James H. Rothrock was a native of Pennsylvania, and as a mere lad
removed to Ohio where he acquired his education at Parker's Academy and
at the Franklin University. He was admitted to the bar at Greenfield,
Ohio, removing to Tipton, Iowa, in 1860. He was elected to the house of
representatives in 1861 and was elected speaker pro tem. He entered the
army as lieutenant, and upon his return from the army formed a
partnership with Judge W. P. Wolf, which lasted until he was nominated
for judge of the eighth judicial district in 1866. He performed
services as judge in that district with ability and impartiality. He
was serving his third term when he was appointed to the bench of the
supreme court.

A few stories may be related of Judge Rothrock which in a way
illustrate his wit and exemplary character:

Judge Rothrock had been trained in the general principles of law and
did not go much on statute law. At one time he was one of a committee
to examine a number of persons for admission to the bar, and a young,
bright fellow seemed to have committed to memory much of the statute
law of the state, but knew nothing of general principles. The judge
quietly said to the young man. "You surely are in a bad way, my friend,
because the legislature might in a night repeal all the law that you
know."

At another time he was on the bench in Linn county when George W.
Wilson, as receiver, brought in a wagon load of books to prove up a
certain assignment. Judge Rothrock asked why all these books were
brought in, and Wilson replied, "To show up the receivership in the
case, your honor." The judge smiled and said. "Don't you think this
failure was due to too much bookkeeping?"

At one time as he was assigning cases, and not being familiar with some
of the members of the bar, Tom Corbett appeared in a case assigned for
trial. The judge quietly asked Mr. Corbett's name and as Mr. Corbett
arose to speak Judge Hubbard blurted out. "Jot him down plain Tom, that
is enough." Mr. Corbett blushed crimson, whispering to another attorney
that he would get even some day. Judge Hubbard many times afterwards
became the prey to Corbett's heartless raillery, his sharp retorts, and
pungent wit.

At one time there were a number of lawyers engaged in a hotly contested
will matter where Judge Rothrock presided, and as the attorneys talked
back and forth across the table and there was more or less disturbance
in the court room, the judge leaned quietly over, saying in a very
pleasant manner to one of the lawyers who had done most of the
quarreling, that he did not see why he was sitting there. The attorney
quick as a flash replied, "You've got me now, Judge, I don't know."

After his retirement from the bench Judge Rothrock was frequently
called in to assist other attorneys in the trials of equity cases. It
became a standing joke among the members of the bar that when they
found cases in which Judge Rothrock had written the opinion which held
just the opposite of what he was contending for, they were certain to
rub it in, much to the judge's embarrassment.

While Judge Rothrock resided at Tipton he came up to Marion to preside
over a term of court and as there were but few persons around he asked
the bystanders if there was anything doing this term of court, to which
they replied that they did not know. He said, "Is Doty here," and they
replied that he was. Then he asked, "Is Harper here?" and they said he
had been present for the past day or so. Then he said, "Bailiff, take
my grip and coat, there will be something doing this term of court; I
guess I will stay awhile."

It was Judge Rothrock who made the famous entry of record in several
cases after Doty and Harper had fought for thirty years, "settled by
agreement, each party to pay his own costs, peace declared, the same
being duly ratified by the court." During these years Harper had lost
everything he had, and Doty was content to have his lawyer share the
income out of an eighty acre tract of land and thus felt that he came
out about even. He figured that the lawyer got the better half of the
income of this farm during all the years the litigation continued.

In 1876 Rothrock was appointed member of the supreme court. He removed
to Cedar Rapids, where he resided until his death in 1899. For thirty
years he was a member of that body and materially assisted in laying
down many sound legal principles which courts in the west have since
followed.

Judge Rothrock was not known as a brilliant judge, but was profound,
and a man endowed by nature with the judicial temperament which so well
fitted him for the bench. His opinions have always been known for
clearness of apprehension, tempered by integrity and impartiality.

J. J. Child, a native of the state of New Jersey, drifted into Cedar
Rapids in 1854 for the practice of his profession. He was a large man,
somewhat stooped, of scholarly attainments, and besides had more than
ordinary native ability. Few, if any, excelled Mr. Child in knowledge
of legal principles and their application to existing facts, although
many excelled him in the court room and before juries.

J. J. Child, J. J. Snouffer, and I. N. Whittam were instrumental in
obtaining the special charter for Cedar Rapids in 1856. In the
municipal affairs of Cedar Rapids Mr. Child held many offices up to the
time of his death in 1889. He possessed talents of a very high order,
but his mode of life lessened his influence in the community. Capable
of most any position, he achieved little or no success, and died poor
and unknown, because the baneful influences of drink sapped his
vitality and ruined a brilliant intellect.

One of the most original characters in the '70s was Jerry Lynch, who
had practiced law in Benton county before coming to Cedar Rapids. Mr.
Lynch was resourceful as a lawyer, had a keen sense of humor, and
possessed a great deal of ability. It is said that when Jerry had two
glasses to the wind he was in his element, especially in defending a
criminal, for it is said of him that "he always denied everything and
asked for proof." At one time he was prosecuting certain persons and
realized that he had no proof. The rain was pouring down, and as he
looked out of the window he said with all the dignity of a judge, "Your
Honor, on account of the inclemency of the weather I dismiss the
case."

At another time he was opposed by several lawyers who made fun of his
partner's military record. There is nothing that so touches the
Irishman's heart as an exhibit of disloyalty, and Jerry arose to reply,
saying, "My friend on the other side laughs at my co-counsel's military
record. Let me tell you what he did during the war. He sat on top of
the northern mountain peak of Vermont with his breeches padded ready to
slide into Canada at the first intimation of the draft." There were a
number of soldiers on that jury and it is needless to say that Jerry
won his ease, regardless of the legal questions involved.

Mr. Lynch at one time defended a saloonkeeper, and was waiting his turn
as Judge Shane passed sentence of "guilty" upon one after another.
Jerry arose to speak for his client saying, "It is an unpleasant duty I
am called upon to perform. I defend the worst saloonkeeper in Cedar
Rapids. He runs the worst hole-in-the-wall in Cedar Rapids, and I have
been in there myself and I am ashamed to tell your honor that it is so.
I am not defending my client, for he is a law-breaker and everybody
knows it." And he went on telling about the depraved individual who ran
the saloon, and then he began: "I am not defending the saloon, I would
not be here for that, but that man has a wife and children, and as nice
children you ever did see." Then he went on telling about the kindness
of that wife who was mistreated by a drunken brute of a husband till
tears came into many eyes in that room. The sympathies of the judge
were aroused and Jerry's client was duly acquitted.

Frank Hormel came to Cedar Rapids as a young man, from Ohio, possessing
education and courteous manners. It might be well said of him, that
from nothing he attained to an income of $10,000.00 a year. Mr. Hormel
was lank and lean in appearance; was a student who devoted his nights
to old "Father Antics," the law. He argued to the court with much
success and was discreet and dexterous before a jury. He was kind
hearted and generous to a fault, and attracted friends by the
brilliancy of his conversation.

Mr. Hormel has been declared by the older members of the bar as a
remarkable man for adroitness in a law suit and for knowledge at every
stage of the case. He was a person of many parts and varied culture,
who just before he had turned fifty was literally worn out on account
of the strenuous life he had been living. He set his stakes high and
paid the penalty.

Just after the Civil war a number of young men drifted into Linn
county, a number of whom had seen service and who later became lawyers,
doctors, and bankers in this and adjoining counties.

Among a number of attorneys who located here during the '60s these may
be mentioned: Mason P. Mills, John J. Powell, Charles B. Keeler, Frank
Hormel, Judge Leach, Judge Spangler, T. J. Dudley, Jr., A. R. West, H.
G. Bowman, D. L. Palmer, J. C. Davis, J. W. Bull, A. V. Eastman, Henry
Rickel, C. M. Hollis, C. S. Lake, Judge J. D. Giffin, Colonel Charles
A. Clark, B. F. Heins, and many others. These were all young men and
all became more or less noted in the legal profession, as well as
socially and politically.

Mase Mills was a business getter, but not a sound lawyer. He neither
had the ability nor inclination for discrimination. He said of himself
that in his native place when a boy, when a medicine faker threw out
peanuts for the boys to fight over, he always got his share. In the
rough and tumble of law suits he was fairly successful for the reason
that he always associated himself with lawyers of ability. He was a
jolly good fellow, a great mixer, and knew men.

Mr. Powell had been in the army, was a college graduate, and soon took
a leading place among the attorneys at the bar in this county. He
passed away in January, 1908, one of the best known and most highly
respected citizens of the city of Cedar Rapids.

Benjamin Franklin Heins was in his day and generation a much talked of
man. Of Ben Heins many stories may be told. He was noted for getting
his English mixed and his penmanship conformed to no rule, while
Murray's grammar had never come under his notice. A wag once demurred
to Ben's petition as follows: To count one, for the reason that it
could not be read; to count two, because it was unintelligible, and the
demur was sustained. Ben ran for alderman and gave up a day or two
before election, as he had one hundred votes to the good. The day after
election his friends met at his office to ascertain the cause of his
defeat, when Ben broke out, "Well, gentlemen, I did not know till today
that there were two hundred liars in my ward."

Ben was not a great lawyer, but he had much business. During the Texas
oil speculation one of the oil boomers came to Ben and offered him
fabulous wages to take him around among his German clients to sell oil
stock. Ben soon saw the trick and replied to the boomer as follows: "My
enemies won't bite on this proposition, and I do not wish to soak my
friends in this way. You better look for some other sucker."

Mills & Keeler were in partnership a number of years, mostly engaged in
railway litigation. Mr. Keeler became known outside the confines of the
state, and died scarcely past middle life at the head of the legal
department of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway, with offices
in Chicago. Mr. Keeler was short of stature, with black hair and beard,
and in a law suit very nervous. It is said that during the Bever will
trial Colonel Clark, in the midst of the trial, said to Keeler, "If you
will only put a feather in your hair, Charley, you would make an ideal
Mephistopheles without any further makeup." Mr. Keeler was a shrewd,
wide-awake lawyer, whose mental constitution peculiarly fitted him for
the practice of law, who possessed the faculty of crowding the salient
features of a case in a few words, and who knew better than most
lawyers what the law ought to be if he could not cite a case in point.
He was cold-blooded and had few warm friends, but everyone acknowledged
his abilities. His restless brain simply burnt up his tissues long
before his time.

Mr. Bowman excelled as a brilliant jury lawyer, who by his magnetic
personality knew how to handle a jury and to obtain a favorable
verdict, especially on the defense in a criminal suit where he could
appeal to the sympathies of the jury. Mr. Bowman possessed the magnetic
quality to attract persons to him, and was one of the most resourceful
lawyers at the bar.

Of the early practitioners at the bar all have passed away or have
retired except Judge J. H. Preston, a son of Colonel Preston, still in
practice in Cedar Rapids, and Major William G. Thompson.

Major Thompson must be given space in this sketch. He was an associate
of Hubbard, Isbell, Cook, Stephens, Corbett, Young, McIntosh, Mitchell,
Sanford, David, and Greene. Judge Thompson is a native of Butler
county, Pennsylvania, where he was born in 1830. He was reared on a
farm, received his early education in a log school house and became a
teacher. He attended an academy where he remained two years, when he
began the study of law, supporting himself by working for his
employers. At twenty-five he was admitted to the bar, and in 1853
located in Marion for the practice of his profession. He was a member
of the state convention at Iowa City in 1856 when the republican party
was organized. In this year he was also chosen a member of the state
senate, serving in the Sixth and Seventh General Assemblies. In 1864 he
was one of the presidential electors, and was elected district
attorney, serving six years. The office of general justice of the
territory of Idaho was offered him in 1879 which he accepted, but was
elected to congress from the fifth district the same year to fill a
vacancy and was re-elected for the next regular term. In 1885 he was
elected to the Twenty-first General Assembly and was an important
factor in the impeachment proceedings against Auditor Brown. In 1894
Judge Thompson was appointed judge of the eighteenth judicial district
and served in that capacity until he retired a few years ago on account
of advanced age.

A few stories may be told about Major Thompson to give the reader an
idea of the man and of the times. Tall, spare, and of commanding
stature, with a wonderful command of language, he would convulse a
witness or magnetize a jury with his quaint sayings, and in a minute
would melt them into tears with his pathos or arouse them to
indignation by his denunciations of what he believed was wrong.

In the Bever will case, in which Thompson appeared for the contestants,
he was to open the case to the jury, when Hubbard who had full charge
of the case, said that he wanted Thompson to speak at least two days.
The major replied, "Great God man, what shall I say to that jury except
that here is the will and there are the girls, they should have part of
this estate?" He made the longest jury argument he ever made in his
life, which did not exceed forty minutes, but he won the case.

Another incident in the Bever will case might be mentioned. After the
case had gone to the highest court the parties agreed to compromise.
They objected to fees which were very large. Sheriff Dan Kinley had a
fee bill of $1,000.00, which the parties contested. The motion was set
down for hearing, when Kinley stepped up and wanted his matter disposed
of. Judge Wolf was on the bench and asked if the sheriff had any
lawyer. He replied, "No, I asked several lawyers and they all claimed
they were retained on one side or the other." The judge looked down
upon an array of lawyers, counting about fifteen, and said, "All right,
go ahead gentlemen." As the long string of lawyers came out after the
hearing Major Smith came along and said to the judge, who came out with
Kinley, "How about that motion for fees, Judge, which you have been
hearing?" "Well," replied Wolf, "there were twenty lawyers on the other
side, and after lengthy arguments Dan and I managed to beat them."

When Judge Thompson was on the bench he used to sentence criminals like
this: "You deserve just ten years in the pen, or as long as the law
allows. You should stay there. I never heard any good you ever did. But
I see your wife here. She looks like a good woman: I'll give you thirty
days in jail."

At one time a woman came to Thompson to get a divorce from her husband.
The judge heard her story. She stated that when the husband came home
and the meals were not ready he would simply rave. "How does he act
when you do have the meals ready?" "Oh, he acts all right then,"
replied the woman. "Well," said the judge, "I advise you to go home and
feed the brute, and you will have no trouble."

On the stump the judge was often accused of waving the "bloody shirt,"
and he used to reply to his opponents that "he knew what he was waving,
because he had been there." When in congress the major was a member of
the committee to try the contested election cases. Colonel R. G.
Ingersoll was one of the attorneys frequently employed by the
contestants and he became very friendly with the members of this
committee. One morning as the colonel entered and found the major
looking over some of the records, the great orator, looking at the Iowa
congressman, said, "Major, I like you." Thompson looked up and
inquired, "Why so, Colonel?" "Well," replied the magnetic orator,
"because if I can establish the fact that my client is running on the
republican ticket I have won my case with you, but it takes a great
deal more to convince the other members of your committee."

George W. Wilson was an old character at the bar of Linn county, and
many are the cases on our county records with the words, G. W. Wilson
_per se_. He brought more worthless cases than any other firm or
individual and was the owner of more tax titles than any other
individual in this or any other county in Iowa. His tax titles were so
clouded that the court intimated in a certain execution "that they
would never fasten on anything in particular."

Linn county has had its share of "constant litigants." The dam across
the river has been a constant eyesore, with rights vested and
otherwise. There has not been a time since the franchise was granted by
the state for dams up to the present time that some suit has not been
pending in the district or supreme court involving some phase of the
property rights of the respective owners in common. The so-called legal
ownership of the dam is now supposed to be vested in the city of Cedar
Rapids, and fees are no longer forthcoming, so during the past few
years there has been a lull in this branch of litigation.

William Harper, J. W. Traer, J. P. Glass, John Weare, W. S. Cooper, N.
B. Brown, Colonel J. M. May, J. J. Snouffer, G. W. Wilson, Theresa
O'Connell, Doc Paul, and Lewis & Mason kept the legal mill grinding for
many years. However, by common consent, Elias Doty, son of one of the
first settlers, seems to have held the trump card for litigation in the
number of suits that he has brought and defended. He is something like
Micawber in this particular that "he has become acquainted with the law
by being made a party so often." It is said that Doty started his
litigation by taking a law book in a horse trade, from which he got a
smattering of law, which volume was cited in many trials until some
up-to-date lawyer ruled the book out before a justice because it had
been printed in England.

The Bever will case was one of the most hotly contested cases in the
county on account of the large interests at stake and the prominence of
the interested parties as well as the prominence and standing of the
attorneys employed.

Many have questioned whether the lawyer of the future will occupy the
same position in the community as the pioneer lawyers. The legal
business is rapidly changing, and before many years the successful
lawyer will be one who renders legal opinions as to what the law is
before suit is brought, and there will be less and less of great
speeches delivered "amid full houses and loud cheers." The pioneer
lawyer arose to distinction and political preferment by force of his
native ability. It is doubtful if we shall in the future have a class
of attorneys who will play such an important part in the upbuilding of
the county and of the state. It is doubtful if we ever shall look upon
their kind again.

The practicing attorneys of Linn county at this time are as follows:

Bingham, Don Barnes, Fred A. Bowman, George F. Buresh, Frank C. Byers,

LINN COUNTY JUSTICES

In pioneer days the township justice played an important part in the
growth and progress of the community. He acted as the safe counsellor
and the family adviser. He drew up all sorts of legal papers, settled
strifes, legalized marriages. It was in the justice court that the new
lawyer would show off his ability. It was an age when "wit and whiskey
were the principal things at the bar," and the early lawyers by nature
possessed the one and frequently partook of the other.

Before these country tribunals these young fellows at the bar were not
miserly of their eccentricities by any means. The justice courts in
olden times were held under the oaks in summer and in blacksmith shops
and grist mills in colder weather, and here when law was not made, the
politics and gossip of the day were often discussed. The justice was
always a leader in his community, and he led in many ways. The story
frequently went "as goes the justice so goes the township." The voter
placed faith in the judgment of the justice and he ruled the community
sometimes with an iron hand. However, the dictatorial justice soon lost
caste and some one else would be chosen at the next election. Much good
work was done by the frontier justice as peace maker, for often where
quarrels arose involving a whole neighborhood he would fix it up in
some way, asserting with all the powers at his command that "it was a
dirty suit" which must be settled.

They were as a rule men of character and of influence, and fearless
when it came to dealing out justice to offenders and those who openly
violated the law. Of course they were backed by the sturdy farming
population who could be depended upon to stand up for the rules as laid
down by the justice.

Many stories may be told at the expense of the country justice. It is
related of an old New Englander in Monroe township that when a case
came before him as to certain offenses and the attorney for the
defendant saw that the feelings of the justice were against him he made
a motion that the guilt or innocence of the victim be put to a vote of
the house. While he thought this was a little strange, still his sense
of justice and his New England training asserted itself and the crowd
voted that the party should go free, against the protest of the
attorney for the state.

Dr. J. H. Camburn was an able justice. The way he would take things in
hand and decide matters were worth going a distance to see and hear.
Dr. Camburn was decidedly practical and had good sense. It is said that
John Weare made a better justice than Dave King, for King had friends
at times whom he wanted to help while Weare had no friends.

Justice Snyder, of Putnam township, sentenced a poor fellow at one time
to the penitentiary for stealing a bee tree when a tree of that kind
and a whole acre of land on which it grew would not be worth more than
$5.00. The constable marched the poor fellow across the country to the
sheriff's office, awaiting further instructions. The sheriff sent the
constable home and told the prisoner to go home, as the justice had
exceeded his authority. The scare at least made the poor fellow forever
afterwards an ideal citizen and the justice always thought that he had
done a good job after all even though he had exceeded his authority.

Many of the fathers and grandfathers of the present generation look
back with pride upon the work accomplished by their ancestors who held
down the justice's office in some of the townships of the county. Who
does not remember such names as J. G. Cole, Isaac Butler, Bob Hodgin,
Ed Crow, William Abbe, Burnett, Coquillette, Knickerbocker, L. L.
Davis, Israel Mitchell, Wm. Ure, R. M. Gunnison, Wm. Cooper, J. S.
Anderson, John Stewart, C. W. Phelps, Aaron Mohr, Thos. Goudy, J. M.
Afftery, J. W. Babbitt, W. H. Hunter, H. B. Burnapp, J. Shearer, Geo.
Greene, and scores of others.

[Illustration: AFTER THE SAC AND FOX CESSION OF 1837 (map)]

[Illustration: LATE DIVISION OF THE BLACK HAWK PURCHASE (map)]

These frontier justices were many of them men of culture and education,
such as Mitchell and Judge Greene. Many of them were shrewd, as Wm.
Ure, Gunnison, Butler, Nugent and many others. These men saw into
schemes which were frequently played upon men of the community and woe
unto the man who got caught in such a game in the new community where
all stood by the justice and the justice's rule was the supreme law in
those days. But the country justice, whatever his ability, always
decided on the side of justice and mercy.

The country justice was a self made man of sound judgment and by fair
dealings was the arbiter of the fortunes of the county in an early day.
He is worthy of mention as a type of the pioneer who took an active
interest in the upbuilding of the county and in preserving order and
enforcing law.

The following items show the importance of the justices in "ye olden
time." These were found by a member of the S. H. Tryon family and
presented to the Linn County Historical Society.

and himself; that he is in fear of the defendant and dare not leave his
home and follow his occupation. That William Cress duly brought the
defendant into Court; that defendant denied that he was guilty and
asked for trial. J. Hunt appeared for the State; defendant pleaded his
own case; that after examination of witnesses separately and arguments
made, the testimony all being understood by the court, thereupon it is
considered that defendant go free without day or date.




CHAPTER XXII

_The Schools of the County_


Schools in Linn county came into existence almost as early as the first
settlers arrived here. Most of the pioneers came from homes of culture
and refinement and hence appreciated the value of an education. There
were no public schools at first. Teachers were employed by private
subscription. Lessons were taught in the settler's cabin, fitted up
with rough boards or puncheons, and of course the attendance was small.

The organic law which provided for the division of Wisconsin and Iowa
makes no provision for education, and no reference to it. On January
15, 1839, an act was passed by the Council and House of Representatives
of the Territory of Iowa, providing for "grants of property made for
the encouragement of education." This act has no bearing whatever on
our present school system. It deals expressly with donations and gifts
for educational purposes.

The real beginning of our present school system is embodied in "An Act
to Establish a System of Common Schools," approved by the Council and
House of Representatives of the Territory of Iowa, January 16, 1840.

There are many surprises in this bill when one compares it to our
present school laws; in fact, many of our school laws have not been
materially changed since the enactments of 1840. It is interesting to
note that according to the provisions of this bill, the school library
is not a new idea, but it was provided for. In Section thirteen,
paragraph five, the qualified voters in each district were given power
to "impose a tax sufficient for the purchase of a suitable library
case, also a sum not exceeding ten dollars annually, for the purchase
of books to be selected by a vote of the district, by the district
board, when so directed." Paragraph six of the same section designates
"the place where the library shall be kept, and the person by whom it
shall be kept;" and states that "the superintendent of public
instruction shall establish the necessary rules for the regulation of
the library." Section fifteen provides that "every person elected to
any one of the above offices who, without sufficient cause, shall
neglect or refuse to serve shall forfeit to the district for the use of
the library the sum of ten dollars, to be recovered in an action of
debt by the assessor before any court of competent jurisdiction."

Another interesting item is the fact that school inspectors instead of
school directors at that time had charge of the schools. In Section
twenty-three, these inspectors are provided for in the following words:
"There shall be chosen at each annual township meeting, three school
inspectors in the same manner as other township officers are chosen,
who shall hold their office until others are chosen."

It was the duty of these inspectors, according to Section twenty-nine
of this Act, to examine closely all persons presenting themselves as
candidates for teaching in their township, and although a certificate
may have been issued to a teacher, if the inspectors became
dissatisfied, under Section thirty, they might again require the
teacher to be re-examined, and if in their opinion the teacher was
found wanting the requisite qualifications, their certificates might be
annulled by giving the teacher ten days' notice, and filing the same
with the clerk of the township.

Judge Milo P. Smith when entering upon the duties of his school at
Wire's Corners, just east of Springville, was examined by this method,
and it is quite interesting to hear him tell his early experiences in
the schools of Linn county. Quite vividly does he bring to one's mind
the sparsely settled condition of the neighborhood around Springville
and Viola, when relating an incident regarding his trip from this
school house to a party where he had been invited to spend the evening.
After arranging his records and outlining the lessons for the next day,
the Judge states that he started for his destination, and about ten
o'clock at night realized that he was completely lost. Evidently he
must have traveled in a circle, for he states that about two or three
o'clock the next morning he saw a gleam of light flash out of a door.
Starting immediately in that direction, he arrived at the place where
the party was held, just in time to ride home with the young folks.

At the same session, a law was passed regarding the sale of the school
lands, and this law was approved January 17, 1840.

On February 17, 1842, a bill was passed creating the office of
Superintendent of Public Instruction. The duties of this officer at
this time was very limited; they being of a clerical nature instead of
those of a supervisor. Of course there could be no school districts or
anything of that nature organized in the county until after some county
organization. The bill calling for the organization of Linn county was
not passed until 1840. It is quite interesting to know that it was at
this time that the Commissioner or rather what is known to-day as the
Supervisor Districts were laid out. The bill reads as follows:

     "Section 1. Be it enacted by the Council and House of
     Representatives of the Territory of Iowa, That the board of
     county commissioners in and for the county of Linn, be and
     they are hereby authorized and required to lay off the
     county aforesaid into three county commissioners' districts,
     prior to the first day of August, A. D. eighteen hundred and
     forty-one, making the division as nearly as possible in
     proportion to the population of said county; and the
     districts shall be classified by said commissioners as
     districts number one, number two, and number three.

     "SEC. 2. That at the next general election there shall be
     elected from district number one one county commissioner;
     and alternately thereafter there shall be elected from each
     district one county commissioner annually, in accordance
     with the provisions of an act organizing a board of county
     commissioners in each county in this Territory, approved
     December 14th, A. D. eighteen hundred and thirty-eight, in
     like manner as though the county had been divided under the
     provisions of said act.

     "Approved, December 31, 1840."

This is especially interesting, inasmuch as there has been a great deal
of discussion of late regarding the number of supervisors in Linn
county. The districts as laid out at that time remain today.

By an act of the same Assembly, approved June 13, 1841, Marion was
established as a seat of justice of Linn county, and the commissioners
of Linn county were authorized to employ agents to sell lots.

The office of the superintendent of public instruction seemed to have
been short-lived, for on February 17, 1842, an act was passed by the
territorial legislature which repealed the act of creating the office
of superintendent of public instruction.

In 1846 an act was passed January 15th, which in some respects amended
an act "To Establish a System of Common Schools," which was passed in
1840. This bill (the one of 1845) really made what is now known as the
county auditor, the educational head of the schools, and provided a tax
for their support.

In chapter 99, page 127, of the Territorial Statutes of 1847, there is
an act relating to the common schools. In section 36, page 134, it
provides that at the next annual township election (which evidently
must have been held in the spring) there was to be elected a school
fund commissioner. This commissioner is what is now known as the county
superintendent of schools, and his duties were many and varied.

In the election book it is shown that in April, 1852, out of the six
hundred and ninety-one votes cast, Alpheus Brown received five hundred
and seventy-three, and was declared elected. In the formation and
alteration of school districts, the records of the county go back as
far as 1849, in which records Mr. Brown signed as school fund
commissioner. However, this may be attributed to the fact that previous
to 1852, Mr. Brown was clerk of the county board of commissioners, and
the duties of the school fund commissioner devolved upon that office at
that time; consequently the presumption is that when he entered upon
his duties as school fund commissioner, and began to make up his
records, he naturally took from the records of the clerk of the board
of county commissioners the things which belonged to the office.

Mr. Brown held this office for three full terms, also about six or
eight months additional time, although Albert A. Mason was elected and
qualified as county superintendent of schools in the election of April,
1858. Mr. Brown served until January, 1859, as school fund
commissioner. This came from the fact that the county superintendent
was provided for by the Statute of '58, the election taking place on
the first Monday in April, but at this time some of the duties devolved
upon the county superintendent. By chapter 36 of the Statutes of 1858,
section 1, the office of the school fund commissioner was continued
until the county treasurer was elected. The presumption is, therefore,
that for about six months we had both a school fund commissioner and a
county superintendent of schools in this county.

It is possible, also, that Mr. Brown served as a sort of triumvirate,
as he was school fund commissioner by election, for the simple reason
that Mr. Mason may not have qualified until three or four days after
the time set; he was also school fund commissioner by the extension
Statute, and county superintendent of schools from the fact that his
successor had not qualified; in fact in some of the school reports, he
signed as both school fund commissioner and county superintendent.
However, Mr. Mason entered upon his duties and served as superintendent
of schools for one term, when Ira G. Fairbanks (who by the way, still
lives in Mount Vernon) was elected as his successor.

It is a difficult matter to state who was the first school teacher in
the county. In 1839 several schools were in operation. In July of that
year Elizabeth Bennett taught in Linn Grove, and later that same year
Judge Greene taught at Ivanhoe. One of the noted schools of the early
day was the one known as the "Buckskin School," in Linn Grove, so named
because teacher and scholars alike attended clad in buckskin suits.

The first school district was formed in 1840 with Marion as its center.
After that school houses sprang up in every direction. The buildings
were constructed out of logs; the seats were benches hewn from slabs or
logs, and so were the desks.

Colleges early sprung up in the county. Of the three that flourished
here more or less at one time, the history of two--Cornell and Coe--are
given at length. These institutions are now in splendid condition.

The third institution that in its day was a power for excellence in
educational lines was Western, founded in 1856 on the borders of
Johnson county at the little town of Western, in College township. Of
this institution the late Jesse A. Runkle, some years ago, wrote as
follows:

     "In January, 1856, Iowa City became the western terminus of
     the only railroad in the state, and no other was built
     within a couple of years. The fine country surrounding
     Western, would easily lead one to believe that the early
     plan was feasible, to make the school an industrial one,
     where deserving young men could make their way through
     school by devoting some of their time to agricultural work.
     But Western was unfortunate in two things: First, none of
     the railroads that were built in Iowa, ever came near the
     town. It seems as if a Nemesis had brooded over the place,
     for even the interurban now being built between Cedar Rapids
     and Iowa City swerves from a direct line, and misses both
     Western and Shueyville by about a mile. Second, the
     surrounding country began to be possessed by a population
     that in the main had little or no sympathy with religious
     education, and the older generations were alien in thought
     and temper to our American institutions. These things made
     the task of maintaining the college at that point a most
     heroic and arduous work."

[Illustration: SHOWING THE TWO CESSIONS AS AT PRESENT DIVIDED (map)]

After some years of struggle, the college was removed to Toledo, where
it now wields an influence second to none in the state.

One of the early educational centers in Linn county was the private
school established in 1850 in the Greene Bros. block, which stood on
the corner of First street and First avenue, Cedar Rapids, where now
stands the building owned by Sunshine Mission. It was founded by Miss
Elizabeth Calder, a native of New York, and who in 1855 married R. C.
Rock, the first hardware dealer in the city, who came here from
Burlington and whose place of business was located on First street a
few doors south of the corner of First avenue. This school prospered
and was conducted by Miss Calder for four years when it was
discontinued.

One of the first, if not the very first, teacher in Cedar Rapids was
Miss Susan Abbe, daughter of the old pioneer. She taught in this city
in 1846, the superintendent being Alexander Ely.

Miss Emma J. Fordyce, at present a teacher in the Cedar Rapids high
school, contributes to this work the following sketch of early schools
in the county, and more particularly in the city of Cedar Rapids:

     "It is not often in this changing country that a person
     lives a lifetime in one community and sees the schools grow
     from their beginning. This has happened to me. Of the early
     country schools but two memories remain: a visit in the
     summer, and one in the winter. There remains an impression
     of very homely school houses, equally homely surroundings,
     and very little comfort without or within. It is a standing
     wonder that even now an Iowa farmer is much more likely to
     provide an up-to-date fine building for his cattle than a
     beautiful, well-ordered school-house for the education of
     his children. A little has been done, but by far too little.

     "Early Cedar Rapids was a little village surrounded by
     groves of oaks, crab-apple, plum, and everywhere the
     climbing wild grape. Between these groves were the sand
     hills on which grew vast quantities of sand-burs. Where the
     Methodist church now stands was a hill which sloped toward
     the railroad. Where the old Presbyterian church was, the
     children coasted down 'Pepper Grass Hill;' and where Mr.
     Crozer's florist establishment is, was a deep and wide pond
     which, on occasions of heavy rain, furnished water for rafts
     made from bits of sidewalk.

     "The earliest school was on the site of the present Granby
     building, but of that school I have no personal knowledge.
     The first school building in my memory was the three-story
     one which was erected in 1856. It had a white cupola, white
     trimmings to the windows, with a high, solid board fence,
     painted red, surrounding it. An iron pump at the side
     furnished refreshment to the spirit and ammunition for the
     wetting of people. On the lower floor on the side next the
     railroad, Miss Elizabeth Shearer taught the children. She
     was a woman of fine family, fine attainments, and of great
     patience of spirit. Superintendent Ingalls was in charge of
     the school at that time. C. W. Burton followed him the next
     year. His school board was A. C. Churchill, president;
     Benjamin Harrison, treasurer; J. W. Henderson,
     vice-president; D. A. Bradley, secretary. These were
     assisted by three directors, J. F. Charles, W. W. Smith, E.
     E. Leach. Mr. Harrison had a unique way of collecting taxes
     from the delinquent foreign citizens to whom our system of
     collecting them was a dark puzzle; when they refused to pay,
     he notified them that on a certain day if the taxes were not
     forthcoming, he would sell everything they had and apply the
     proceeds to tax payment. The auction was often begun, but
     never finished, as the taxes were always forthcoming.

     "Mrs. E. J. Lund was one of the earliest of Cedar Rapids
     teachers. For many years her inspiring example and her
     patient work developed good children out of bad, and she
     finished her life's work by taking care of all the poor and
     unfortunate of the county. The Cedar Rapids superintendents
     were Professor Humphrey, 1861-4, Professor Ingalls, 1864-5,
     C. W. Burton, 1865-70, J. E. Harlan, now president of
     Cornell, 1870-5, F. H. Smith, the latter part of 1875, J. W.
     Akers, 1875-81, W. M. Friesner, 1881-5, L. T. Weld, 1885-6,
     J. P. Hendricks, 1886-90, J. T. Merrill, 1890-1901, J. J.
     McConnell, 1901--, twelve men in thirty-four years. The list
     shows plainly the growing tendency to keep a superintendent
     for long periods at a time.

     "The high school principals show the same tendency; A.
     Wetherby, from 1870-1, E. C. Ebersole, 1872-73, W. A.
     Olmsted, 1871-2, Miss Mary A. Robinson, 1873-86, Miss A. S.
     Abbott, 1886--.

     "The original high school building contained four rooms. In
     1876 it had a corps of three teachers: Miss M. A. Robinson,
     Miss E. J. Meade, Miss Estella Verden, and had an attendance
     of 106 pupils; it now has twenty teachers with an attendance
     of 838 pupils. In 1876 there were five buildings in the
     city; there are now sixteen. Of the teachers thirty-one in
     number in 1876, there are two left: Miss Emma Forsythe and
     Miss Emma J. Fordyce. In 1876 the total number of pupils
     handled by thirty-one teachers was 1,752. In 1911, with 181
     teachers, there are 6,122 pupils, not quite six times as
     many teachers, but showing a smaller average number to each
     teacher. Evidently the school-houses have always been
     crowded, since the superintendent's report of 1876 says: 'We
     have in the school district five school buildings, and these
     are taxed to their utmost to accommodate the pupils already
     enrolled.' He also remarks pensively: 'In your wisdom for
     the coming year, you have reduced the salaries of your
     teachers, and in some cases the reduction has been such that
     some of your best teachers have been compelled to seek
     employment elsewhere.' Since no following superintendent
     makes the same complaint, it is evident that school boards
     do improve. As to salaries, the salary of the superintendent
     in 1883 is given as $1,000; in 1911 as $3,000, which means
     the magnificent increase of $42 a year; not a great
     temptation. The salaries of the teachers increase in the
     same period about $25 a year. Comment is unnecessary.

     "As to the high school, the graduates of 1873 to 1885 were
     but eleven pupils, with nine times as many in 1908. Amongst
     the older and pioneer high school teachers were Mr.
     Wetherbee, Miss Ella Meade, and Miss Ada Sherman, who
     afterward decided to doctor bodies instead of minds, as it
     paid much better. Mr. Olmsted, the principal of 1872, who
     left Cedar Rapids in 1873 to found a business in Chicago,
     died a hero. He lost his life in his burning building trying
     to save his bookkeeper.

     "The tendencies in school work are shown by the fact that
     the reports of the early superintendents are largely lists
     of members of the school board, while the later reports give
     large tabulations of expense. It is to be regretted that
     Iowa has not adopted a series of uniform reports, giving
     items almost impossible to discover as these reports are at
     present made out. The older schools report seventy-two
     pupils to a primary teacher. The newer reports are silent on
     the subject. Since efficiency comes in handling the right
     number of pupils, it would certainly be wise to keep a
     careful account of this item.

     "The courses of the schools show the growth in public
     service. The courses of the high school in 1876 are twenty;
     those of the high school in 1910, eighty-three. All of the
     older and more prominent citizens served as school directors
     at one time or another. In 1858 J. L. Enos was president of
     the board, Freeman Smith, secretary, W. W. Smith,
     vice-president, J. T. Walker, treasurer, W. W. Walker,
     director. In 1859 the names of R. C. Rock, E. H. Stedman, J.
     P. Coulter, and J. M. Chambers appear. In 1860, S. C.
     Koontz, Henry Church, William Stewart, J. H. Camburn, and
     William Richmond served. In 1861, W. W. Smith, George M.
     Howlett, Henry Church, William H. Merritt, A. C. Churchill,
     and S. L. Pollock directed affairs. In 1862 E. G. Brown, A.
     C. Churchill, J. F. Ely, George M. Howlett elected Mr.
     Humphrey superintendent of schools. His reputation seems to
     have been that of a man of great strength and the bad big
     boys stood in awe of him accordingly. C. W. Burton, the
     superintendent of 1865, was noted for his cleverness in
     mathematics, and his deep interest in horticulture.

     "All of these early directors, superintendents, and teachers
     were hard workers and great optimists. History has confirmed
     that optimism, and from the services of these men developed
     a race of ambitious, energetic, moral citizens to whom the
     present Cedar Rapids owes a great debt of gratitude."

Through the courtesy of County Superintendent Alderman we are enabled
to give below some interesting data regarding our schools:

In 1873 the number of school corporations in the county was 42,
increased to 87 in 1909. The number of ungraded schools in the former
year was 178, and 166 in the latter year. The average number of months
the schools were in session has increased from 6.6 in 1873 to 8.9 in
1909, and the average compensation from $39.78 to $73.50 for males, and
from $26.33 to $50.85 for females. The number of female teachers
employed in 1873 was 244, and in 1909, 503. The number of male teachers
was 90 and 40 respectively.

In the matter of attendance there has been a vast betterment. In 1873
there were 460 boys and 544 girls between the ages of seven and
fourteen not in school. In 1909 these numbers were 29 and 17.

The value of school property in 1873 was $240,105; in 1909, $814,300.
The value of school apparatus was $2,309.50 in 1873, and in 1909,
$20,035.25. There were in 1873 in the school libraries 482 volumes,
which was increased to 17,079 in 1909.

There are now between twenty-five and thirty fine school buildings in
the country districts. They are modern in all respects, being supplied
with slate blackboards, hardwood floors, ventilators, cloak rooms,
bookcases and cupboards. Several have furnaces and cloak rooms in the
basements. Some of the buildings are supplied with telephones, making
it possible for the county superintendent and patrons to communicate
direct with the school.

The plans and specifications for these buildings are owned by the
county, and are furnished gratis to the school districts wishing to
build. All of these school-houses except two or three are not only
provided with libraries, cloak rooms, etc., but are also provided with
a good organ.

This year there is being installed a hot air ventilating system which
keeps the warm air pure, the cold air being taken directly from the
outside and passed through the hot air radiators before being allowed
to enter the school room.

CHAPTER XXIII

_Historical Sketch of Cornell College_

BY WILLIAM HARMON NORTON, ALUMNI PROFESSOR OF GEOLOGY, CORNELL COLLEGE


Linn county may well take pride in the history of her oldest school of
higher education, founded in 1853, when the county held but 6,000
people. But the beginnings of Cornell College are of more than local
interest; they are thoroughly typical of America and of the West.
Cornell was founded in much the same way as were hundreds of American
colleges along the ever advancing frontier of civilization from
Massachusetts to California--a way which the world had never seen
before and will never see again.


THE FOUNDATION AND THE FOUNDER

Cornell owes its inception to a Methodist circuit rider, the Rev.
George B. Bowman, a North Carolinian by birth, who came to Iowa from
Missouri in 1841, three years after the territorial organization of the
commonwealth. This heroic pioneer, resourceful, far seeing, and
sanguine of the future, eminent in initiative and in the power of
compelling others to his plans, was one of those rare men to whom the
task of building states is intrusted. He was not himself a college man,
but with him education was a passion. To found institutions of higher
education he considered his special mission. Hardly had he been
appointed as pastor of the church at Iowa City in 1841 when he
undertook the building of a church school, called Iowa City College. In
1845 Rev. James Harlan, a local preacher of Indiana, was chosen
president, and with one assistant opened the school in 1846. The next
year Mr. Harlan was elected state superintendent of public instruction,
and the college was closed never to be re-opened. It had at least
served to bring to the state one of its most distinguished citizens,
afterward to be honored with the United States senatorship and the
secretaryship of the interior. Meanwhile Mr. Bowman had been appointed
presiding elder of the Dubuque district, which then included much of
east-central Iowa. The failure of the premature attempt at Iowa City
had not discouraged him; he awaited the favorable opportunity he still
looked for--suitable local conditions for a Christian college in the
state. It is a long-told legend, even if it be nothing more than
legend, that when Elder Bowman came riding on horseback to the Linn
Grove circuit, he stopped on the crest of the lonely hill on which
Mount Vernon now stands. From its commanding summit vistas of virgin
prairie and primeval forest stretched for ten and twenty miles away.
Here there fell upon him, the circuit preacher, the trance and vision
of the prophet. He saw the far-off future; he heard the tramp of the
multitudes to come. Dismounting, he kneeled down in the rank prairie
grass and in prayer to Almighty God consecrated this hill for all time
to the cause of Christian education. And it is a matter of authentic
history that in the spring of 1851 Elder Bowman and Rev. Dr. A. J.
Kynett, in the parsonage at Mount Vernon, planned together for the
early founding and upbuilding of a Christian college on this site.

With the characteristic initiative of the Iowa pioneer, Bowman did not
wait for authority to be given him by anybody, for articles of
incorporation to be drawn up, or even for a title deed to the land on
which the college was to stand. Early in 1852 he laid his plans for the
launching of the school. On the Fourth of July of this year an
educational celebration was held at Mount Vernon, which drew the
farmers for miles about the town, and other friends of the new
enterprise from Marion and Cedar Rapids, Anamosa, Dubuque, and
Burlington. The oration of the day was delivered by State
Superintendent Harlan on the theme of Education, and at its close
ground was broken formally for the first building of the college. A
month later a deed was obtained for the land and the following
September the guardianship of the infant school was accepted under the
name of the Iowa Conference Seminary, by the Methodist Episcopal
church.

In this highly democratic manner Cornell College was founded by the
people as an institution of higher learning, which should ever be of
the people and for the people. It was born on the anniversary of the
nation's natal day, and was to remain one of the highest expressions of
patriotism and civic life. Christened by the head of the educational
interests of the young commonwealth, supported by its citizens,
protected by a charter from the state, and exempt as a beneficent
institution of the state from contributing by taxation to the support
of other institutions, the college was thus begun as a state school in
a very real sense.

One can not read the early archives of the college without the
profoundest admiration for the pioneers, its founders. Avid of
education to a degree pathetic, they depended on no beaurocracy of
church or state; they waited for no foreign philanthropy to supply
their educational needs. They laid the foundations of their colleges
with the same free, independent, self-sufficing spirit with which they
laid their hearthstones, and they laid both at the same time.


THE IOWA CONFERENCE SEMINARY

In January, 1853, the first meeting of the board of trustees was held,
and in the fall of the same year the school was opened in the old
Methodist church at Mount Vernon. Before the end of the term a new
edifice on the campus was so far completed that it was available for
school purposes and "on the morning of November 14, 1853, the school
met for the last time in the old church and after singing and prayer
the students were formed in line and walked in procession with banners
flying, led by the teachers, through the village, and took formal
possession of what was then declared to be a large and commodious
building."[J]

The first catalog--a little time-stained pamphlet of fifteen
pages--lists the following faculty:

Rev. Samuel M. Fellows, A. M., professor of mental and moral science
and belle lettres.

Rev. David H. Wheeler, professor of languages.

Miss Catherine A. Fortner, preceptress.

Miss Sarah L. Matson, assistant.

Mrs. Olive P. Fellows, teacher of painting and embroidery.

Mrs. Sophia E. Wheeler, teacher of instrumental music.

The first board of trustees is also noteworthy:

Rev. George B. Bowman, president, Mount Vernon; E. D. Waln, Esq.,
secretary, Mount Vernon; Rev. H. W. Reed, Centerville; Rev. E. W.
Twining, Iowa City; Rev. J. B. Taylor, Mount Vernon; Jesse Holman,
North Sugar Grove; Henry Kepler, North Sugar Grove; William Hayzlett,
Mount Vernon; A. I. Willits, Mount Vernon.

The roster of students enrolls 104 gentlemen, and 57 ladies. Among them
are familiar and honored names, some of which are to reappear in all
later catalogs of the school, either as students of the second and
third generation, or as trustees and members of faculty. Four Rigbys,
for example, were students in 1853. In 1910 the catalog lists three
Rigbys, one a student and two members of the faculty. The first catalog
contains the names of no less than nine Keplers as students, six
stalwart young men from North Sugar Grove and their three sisters. Four
Walns are enrolled from Mount Vernon, two Farleys from Dubuque and two
Reeders from Red Oak.

In 1853 the population of the entire state was only about 300,000. Not
a railway had been projected west of the Mississippi river. And yet the
scattered settlements sent across the unbroken prairie and the
unbridged rivers no less than 161 students to the young school on this
the first year of its existence. The most important route to Mount
Vernon was the military road extending from Dubuque to Iowa City. Both
towns contributed their quota of students, Dubuque sending no less than
twelve, although the entire population of Dubuque county was then, less
than 16,000. Considering the difficulty of communications, the poverty
of the pioneers, the wide extent of the sphere of influence of the
school is remarkable. Students were drawn this first year from as far
to the northeast as Elkader and Garnavillo. They came from Dyersville
and Independence, from Quasqueton and Vinton, from Marengo, Columbus
City, West Liberty, and Burlington. Muscatine alone sent seven
students. This town was at the time the point of supply for Mount
Vernon, and the materials for the first building of the college except
such as local saw mills and brick kilns could supply were hauled from
that river port.[K] Students came also from Davenport, Le Claire,
Princeton, and Blue Grass in Scott county, from Comanche, and from the
pioneer settlements of La Motte and Canton in Jackson county. The eight
hundred students of Cornell today reach the school from all parts of
the state and the adjacent portions of our neighboring states by a few
hours swift and comfortable ride by rail. But who shall picture in
detail the long and adventurous journeys in ox cart and pioneer wagon
and perchance often on foot of the boys and girls of 1853--the climbing
of steep hills, the fording of rivers, the miring in abysmal sloughs,
the succession of mile after mile of undulating treeless prairie
carpeted with gorgeous flowers stretching unbroken to the horizon, the
camp at night illuminated by distant prairie fires, until at last a
boat shaped hill surmounted by a lonely red brick building lifts itself
above the horizon, and the goal of the long journey is in view!

No doubt there were other hardships awaiting these students after their
arrival. Rule No. 1 of the new school compelled their rising at five
o'clock in the morning. They were expected to furnish their own beds,
lights, mirrors, etc., when boarding in Seminary Hall. It is
interesting to note that they paid for tuition $4.00 and $5.00 per
quarter, and for board from $1.50 to $1.75 per week. The next year the
steward's petition to the board of trustees that he be allowed to put
three students in each of the little rooms was granted with the proviso
"that he furnish suitable bunks for the same." The catalog's statement
regarding apparatus is a guarded one: "The Institution is furnished
with apparatus for illustrating some of the most important principles
of Natural Science. As the wants of school demand, additions will be
made to this apparatus." And that regarding the library is wholly
prophetic: "It is intended to procure a good selection of _readable_
and _instructive_ books, by the commencement of the next academic year,
to which the students will have access at a trifling expense. With
these books as a nucleus, a good library will be accumulated as rapidly
as possible. Donations of _good_ books are solicited from friends of
the institution." In the next catalog it is stated that "a small but
good selection of _readable_ and _instructive_ books has been
procured," the remainder of the statement being the same as that of
the first year. This statement appeared without change in all
succeeding catalogs during the remainder of the first decade.


THE FIRST DECADE

As early as 1855 the articles of incorporation were amended changing
the name of the institution to Cornell College, in honor of W. W.
Cornell and his brother J. B. Cornell, of New York City, men prominent
in business and widely known for their benevolences to various
enterprises of the church. It will be noted that Cornell College was
thus named several years before the founding by Ezra Cornell, of
Cornell University at Ithaca, N. Y.

The first year of the school under the new collegiate regime was that
of 1857-1858. Rev. R. W. Keeler of the Upper Iowa Conference was made
president, Principal Fellows of the Seminary taking the professorship
of Latin. Two years later President Keeler reentered the more congenial
work of the ministry, and Principal Fellows was elected president of
the college, a position which he held most acceptably until his death
on the day after commencement June 26, 1863, thus completing a full
decade of years of service in the school.

President Fellows had come to Cornell from the Rock River Seminary at
Mount Morris. His character and the quality of his work left lasting
impressions on his pupils at both institutions. Thus Hon. Robert R.
Hitt, of Illinois, writes of him as follows: "He was a diligent, acute,
and active student, and his personal character was admirable. It is the
fortune of few men to exercise so wide and prominent an influence from
a position which, to the ambitious, is not considered eminent." And
Senator Shelby M. Cullom has written: "I regard Professor Fellows as
one of the best men I ever knew. I said it when I was under him at
school, and now that I am over seventy years of age, I say it now. He
was strong, honest-hearted, full of kindness, and a splendid teacher."

His colleague at Cornell, Dr. David H. Wheeler, described him as "a man
sweet-spirited, pure-minded, of fine executive ability, a rarely
qualified teacher, a patient sufferer, a tireless worker, a model
friend."

A word may be said as to the members of President Fellows's faculty:

Miss Catharine A. Fortner, a graduate of Cazenovia Seminary, N. Y., was
sent out in 1851 by Governor Slade, of Vermont, as a missionary teacher
to Iowa. Her success near Tipton was so marked that she was chosen as
the first preceptress of the institution. In 1857 she resigned to marry
Rev. Rufus Ricker, of the Upper Iowa Conference.

Wm. H. Barnes, professor of languages in 1854-1855, resigned to accept
a professorship in Baldwin University, Ohio, and is known as author of
several works in history and politics.

His successor, Rev. B. W. Smith, after leaving the school in 1857
became pastor of several of the largest churches in northern Indiana,
and president of Valparaiso College.

Dr. David H. Wheeler, professor of languages in 1853-1854, and
professor of Greek from 1857 to 1861, when he was appointed U. S.
consul to Genoa, was a brilliant and versatile man, author of a number
of books, professor for eight years at Northwestern University, editor
for eight years of the New York Methodist, and for nine years president
of Allegheny College.

The brother of President Fellows, Dr. Stephen N. Fellows, has a large
place in the educational history of Iowa. He assisted his brother in
laying the foundation of Cornell College, being professor of
mathematics from 1854 to 1860, and later occupied the chair of mental
and moral science and didactics at the State University of Iowa for
twenty years.

On account of her long connection with the college, from 1857 to 1890,
Miss Harriette J. Cooke exerted a more potent influence on the
institution than any of her colleagues of the first decade. Miss Cooke
came to Cornell from Hopkinton, Massachusetts, and brought the best
culture for women which New England then afforded, as well as an
exceptionally forceful personality, and rare natural aptitudes for her
profession. From 1860 to the time of her resignation she was dean of
women, and her influence for good on the thousands of young women under
her care is incalculable. After long service as an instructor she was
made a full professor in 1871, the first woman in America, it has been
said, to be thus honored. Her chair for fifteen years was history and
German, and after 1886 history and the science of government. On
leaving the college she studied the methods of deaconess work in
England, wrote a book upon the subject, and returning to her native
land became one of the leaders in this new department of social
service. For many years she has been closely connected with the
University Settlement of Boston. On the recent celebration of her
eightieth birthday she received hundreds of letters of loving
congratulation from her former students of Cornell, and each of these
letters was answered by her painstakingly and at length.

[Illustration: A STREET SCENE IN MARION]

[Illustration: THE DANIELS HOTEL, MARION]

The first ten years of the institution were marked by a singularly
rapid growth, considering the fact that they included the darkest days
of the Civil war, when nearly every male student was drawn from the
college halls to the service of his country. At the end of the decade
the faculty numbered eight professors and instructors, and 375 students
were enrolled, fifty-one of whom were in college classes, the largest
enrollment of collegiate students in the state, unless at the State
University. The assets of the institution amounted to $50,000 in notes
and pledges, a campus of fifteen acres, and two brick buildings which
compared not unfavorably with other college buildings in the west and
with the earlier halls of Harvard.

In a large measure this exceptional growth was due to Elder Bowman, to
his initiative and wide and powerful influence. The chief problem then
as now was one of sustenance, and as a college beggar Bowman was
incomparable. He travelled over the settled portions of the state,
winning men to his cause by a singular personal charm, and enticing
even out of poverty money, promissory notes at altitudinous rates of
interest, farm produce, live stock and poultry, household furniture and
jewelry. His barnyard at Mount Vernon was continually stocked with
horses, cattle, and chickens--votive offerings to the cause of higher
education. A citizen of the town once told me how under some mesmeric
influence he bought at high price from Elder Bowman an old book case
and coal scuttle, begged somewhere for the school. This prince of
college beggars once returned from Dubuque with a silver watch which he
had plundered off the person of an eminent minister of that city.


FROM 1863 TO 1910--GROWTH IN RESOURCES

Nothing is so tame as the history of a college once the interesting
period of its childhood is over, and the history of Cornell is
exceptionally uneventful among colleges. No building has been destroyed
by fire or tornado. No famous lawsuit against the school has been
defended by some Webster among the alumni. None of the faculty has won
notoriety by sensational speech or erratic morals.

The salient feature of the forty-seven years since 1863 is a marvelous
growth unparalleled in some respects in the history of education. The
campus has been enlarged by addition after addition until now it
measures sixty acres, including the larger part of the long hill and
wide athletic fields along its northern base. To the two first
buildings, still used, one for the chemical, biological and physical
laboratories and the other for class rooms and society halls, there
have been added South Hall, built in 1873 and now used for the
engineering and geological laboratories; the Chapel, completed in 1882,
a stately Gothic structure of stone, containing the auditorium, seating
about 1,500, a smaller audience room, the museum, and several music
rooms; Bowman Hall, built in 1885, as the well appointed home of
ninety-two young women; the library dedicated in 1905, the gift of
Andrew Carnegie; the alumni gymnasium in Ash Park, built in 1909, a
noble structure, one of the largest of the kind in the state, besides
several minor buildings used for allied schools and professors's
residences.

The material equipment has made a phenomenal growth, until several of
the scientific laboratories are reckoned among the best in the Central
West, and the library, numbering 35,000 volumes, ranks as third in size
among the university and college libraries in the state, and second to
but one of the city libraries of Iowa. The museum includes several
collections which rank among the largest in the west: the Kendig
collection of minerals, the Norton collection of fossils, and the
Powers collection in American anthropology.


GROWTH IN ATTENDANCE

From the beginning Cornell has been a relatively large school measured
by the number of its students, and its growth the last decades forbids
it longer to be called a small college. Indeed, for many years it has
maintained its place as the largest denominational college, or among
the two or three largest, in the United States west of the Great Lakes,
reckoned by the number of students of collegiate rank. The attendance
has steadily risen until, in 1909-1910, 741 students were enrolled, 450
of them being in the college of liberal arts. The steady growth in
numbers of collegiate students evidences the satisfaction which the
school has given to its patrons, and an ever widening influence and
power. Moreover, it has increased the efficiency of the school by the
inspiration of numbers and the intensity of competition in all
departments of college life. By bringing together students from all
parts of the state and scores from other states, some with the polish
of the city and others with the sturdy strength of the country, it has
escaped the narrowness of the provincial and has attained something
akin to cosmopolitanism.

To make Cornell an institution state-wide in its patronage and
influence was the evident purpose of its founders. Nothing was further
from their minds than a local college for the students of a town or
county, or one drawing its patronage from a few contiguous counties.
The trustees have been chosen widely over the state and the attendance
from all parts of Iowa has been surprisingly large, considering the
many excellent colleges the state supports. In an investigation made a
few years since of the geographic distribution of the students it was
found that 41 per cent of the collegiate students came from beyond the
borders of the patronizing conference, and the counties west and south
of the Des Moines river furnished 20 per cent of the students in
attendance from the state. The college has thus grown to have a
state-wide field.


THE STRATEGIC POSITION

In explaining the growth of Cornell college we must recognize, of
course, that it has grown up with the country. We must relate the
growth of the school directly to the material prosperity of this land
of corn and swine, to the marvelously fertile soil and to the era of
expansion in which our history falls. The fact remains, however, that
the college has obtained somehow a good deal more than its due share in
the general advance. While the population of the state increased 330
per cent from 1860 to 1900, the collegiate attendance at Cornell
increased 720 per cent. The college has grown more than twice as fast
as has the state, and that notwithstanding the numerous good schools
which have sprung up to share its patronage.

We can not doubt that much of the success of the school has been due to
its strategic position. It is located in a suburban town of the chief
railway center of eastern Iowa. From Cedar Rapids long iron ways, like
the spokes of a wheel, reach in all directions to the limits of the
state and beyond, and bring every portion of the commonwealth and the
adjacent parts of our neighboring states within a few hours ride of
Cornell college. It is located also in east Central Iowa, an area of
the state the first to be settled and developed, an area surpassed by
none in the fertility of its soils, and the wealth which has been
produced from them. To these geographic factors, advantages shared in
like degree by none of the early competitors of the school, we may
assign a place similar to that given such factors in explaining the
growth of New York city and of Pittsburg.

While the college had thus had the city's advantages of communication
and markets because of its nearness to Cedar Rapids, it has retained
all the peculiar advantages which inhere in a location in a village.
Like Bowdoin, Dartmouth, and Oberlin, Cornell has found in the small
town, rather than in the city, an ideal college environment. It has
never permitted the presence of saloon or other haunt of vice. The
citizens with whom the students have made their homes have been people
of culture drawn to the town by its educational advantages. In all that
makes for the intellectual life, in libraries and collections, in
lectures and good music, and church privileges, Mount Vernon has had
more to offer than perhaps any city of the state; while the temptations
and distractions, the round of low amusements offered by the city, have
been fortunately absent.


THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES

More than geographic location, it is great men and great plans that
make great schools. Let us give much credit therefore to the men who
have administered the college as members of its board of trustees. Our
debt to them is like that of Michigan University to its board of
regents whose wise plans pushed it early to the fore among the state
universities of the west and far in advance of the place to which
geographic causes alone would have assigned it. Some of these were
pioneers of only local fame, such as Elijah D. Waln, Henry D. Albright,
William Hayzlett, Jesse Holman, Noah McKean, and Dr. G. L. Carhart, men
whose memory will ever be cherished in Mount Vernon. Others were men of
note in the early history of the state, such as Hon. Hiram Price, of
Davenport, Jesse Farley, of Dubuque, and A. P. Hosford and W. H. Lunt,
of Clinton. Especially to be noted is the long service which the
trustees have given to the school. Of the members of the executive
committee Col. Robert Smyth, sturdy Scotch Presbyterian, was a member
for twenty-eight years until his death in 1896. On the same committee
Hon. W. F. Johnston, of Toledo, long president of the board, has
already served for thirty-three years. Col. H. H. Rood, another of the
members of the executive committee, has served continuously as trustee
since 1867, and Capt. E. B. Soper, of Emmetsburg, since 1878. Captain
Soper has long been one of the most influential members of the
governing board, and it is to his initiative and faith that the alumni
gymnasium is due. Dr. J. B. Allbrook has served since 1874. H. A.
Collin was treasurer of the college from 1860 to his death in 1892.
Hon. D. N. Cooley, of Dubuque, served as trustee for twenty-four years,
and Hon. W. J. Young, of Clinton, for twenty-six years, their terms of
office being terminated only by death. Of the present board of trustees
there may be named as among those longest in service, F. H. Armstrong,
of Chicago; Hon. W. C. Stuckslager, of Lisbon; E. J. Esgate, of Marion;
Maj. E. B. Hayward, of Davenport; Hon. Eugene Secor, of Forest City;
Dr. Edward T. Devine, of New York; T. J. B. Robinson, of Hampton; John
H. Blair, of Des Moines; Rev. W. W. Carlton, of Mason City; Rev. E. J.
Lockwood and John H. Taft, of Cedar Rapids; Hon. Leslie M. Shaw, of
Philadelphia; R. J. Alexander, of Waukon; E. B. Willix, of Mount
Vernon; Senator Edgar T. Brackett, of Saratoga, N. Y.; O. P. Miller, of
Rock Rapids; Rev. Homer C. Stuntz, of Madison, N. J. and N. G. Van
Sant, of Sterling, Ill.

Among the eminent men who have served the college we must give special
mention to Rev. Alpha J. Kynett, one of the pioneers of Methodism west
of the Mississippi, who served on the board from 1865 to his death in
1899. Dr. Kynett was the founder of the great Church Extension society
and for many years was its chief executive. In this capacity he
probably built more churches than any man who has ever lived. For a
third of a century he was a close friend and adviser of the college,
and all his wide experience and his ability as an organizer and
financier were always at its service.


THE ADMINISTRATION

In 1863 occurred the sad death of President Fellows, under whose
superintendence the school had been organized. He was succeeded in
office by William Fletcher King, a graduate of the Ohio Wesleyan
University and a member of its faculty, who thus brought to Cornell an
acquaintance with the scope and methods of one of the best colleges of
the middle west. At the time of his election to the presidency Dr. King
was professor of Latin and Greek at Cornell, and thus for the second
time a president was chosen from the ranks of those actively engaged in
the work of higher education rather than, as was then almost
universally the custom, from those of another profession. In 1908 Dr.
King resigned his office after a term of service of forty-five years.
For a number of years he had thus been the oldest college president in
the United States in the duration of his office. His administration was
essentially a business administration, with little talk but much of
doing. There was in it nothing spectacular, and no pretense, or sham.
No discourteous act ever strained friendly relations with other
schools. Dr. King made no enemies and no mistakes. He was ever tactful,
poised, discreet, far-seeing, winning men to the support of his wise
and well-laid plans but never forcing their acceptance. The college
itself is a monument to this successful business administration. For
Cornell does not owe its success to any munificent gifts. Like John
Harvard, W. W. Cornell and his brother left the college which
perpetuates their memories little more than a good name and a few good
books. No donation of more than $25,000 was received until more than
forty years of the history of the college had elapsed. Whatever
excellence the college has attained is due to the skill and patience of
its builders and not to any unlimited or even large funds at their
disposal.

On the resignation of Dr. King, the presidency passed to his logical
successor, Dr. James Elliott Harlan, who had served as vice president
of the college since 1881. He had long had the management and
investment of the large funds of the college and the administration of
the school in its immediate relations with the students. Just,
sympathetic, patient, he had won the esteem of all connected with the
college, and to him was largely due the exceptional tranquillity which
the college had enjoyed in all its intimate relations. Dr. Harlan was
graduated from Cornell College in 1869. For three years he was
superintendent of the schools of Cedar Rapids, and for one year he held
a similar place at Sterling, Ill. From here he was called to the alumni
professorship of mathematics in Cornell College. The larger part of his
life has thus been bound up inextricably with the school. He knows and
is known and loved by all the alumni and old students. The first year
of his administration was signalized by the erection of the new alumni
gymnasium, and the second by the conditional gift by the general
educational board of $100,000.00 to its endowment funds.

[Illustration: REV. SAMUEL M. FELLOWS, A. M. First President Cornell
College]

The dean of the college since 1902 has been Professor H. H. Freer, a
graduate of the school of the class of 1869, and a member of the
faculty since 1870. Dean Freer was one of the first men in Iowa to see
the need of schools of education in connection with colleges and
universities and was placed at the head of such a school--the normal
department of Cornell--early in the '70s. As has recently been said
of him by Pres. H. H. Seerley, of Iowa Teachers College, "his
connection with teacher education is probably unexcelled in Iowa
educational history and no tribute that can be paid could do justice to
his faithful endeavors." Dean Freer has been most intimately connected
with the administration for many years. In 1873 he organized the
alumni, with the help of Rev. Dr. J. B. Albrook, for the endowment of a
professorship. At that time there were but 108 living graduates,
forty-seven of whom were women. Of the men, only thirty-eight had been
out of college more than three years. Yet this audacious enterprise was
carried through to complete success and was followed by the endowment
of a second alumni chair. In all of the great financial campaigns Dean
Freer has been indispensible, and the moneys he has secured to the
college amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars. More than this, by
his wide acquaintance throughout the state and by his cordial
friendship with all old students, he has been one of the chief
representatives of the college around whom its friends have ever
rallied. Since 1887 he has been professor of political economy in the
college, and now occupies the David Joyce chair of economics and
sociology.


THE FACULTY

Of the nearly 300 teachers who have been enrolled in the faculties of
the college there is space for the mention of but few names: Dr. Alonzo
Collin, who began by teaching all the sciences and mathematics in the
young school in 1860, and resigned in 1906 as professor of physics; Dr.
Hugh Boyd, professor of Latin from 1871 to 1906; Prof. S. N. Williams,
head of the school of civil engineering since 1873; Prof. George O.
Curme, professor of German from 1884 to 1897, now a member of the
faculty of Northwestern University; Dr. W. S. Ebersole, professor of
Greek since 1892; Dr. James A. James, professor of history from 1893 to
1897, now teaching in Northwestern University; Prof. H. M. Kelley,
professor of biology since 1894; Dr. Thomas Nicholson, professor of the
English Bible from 1894 to 1904, now general educational secretary of
the M. E. church; Dr. F. A. Wood, professor of German from 1897 to
1903, now member of the faculty of University of Chicago; Prof. Mary
Burr Norton, alumni professor of mathematics, whose connection with the
faculty dates from 1877; Dr. H. C. Stanclift, professor of history
since 1899; Dr. Nicholas Knight, professor of chemistry since 1899; Dr.
George H. Betts, psychology, who entered the faculty in 1902; Prof. C.
D. Stevens, English literature, since 1903; Prof. C. R. Keyes, German,
since 1903; Miss Mary L. McLeod, dean of women, since 1900; Prof. John
E. Stout, education, since 1903.

The continuity, the long terms of service of the administrative
officers and the professors, can hardly be too strongly emphasized as a
potent factor in the growth of the college. If the history of the
school had seen a rapid succession of different presidents and frequent
changes of faculty, if there had been changes in plans and purposes,
factions and struggles, and the loss of friends which such struggles
entail, if the power of the machinery had been wasted in internal
friction we may be sure that the story of the college would have been
far other than it is.


THE ALUMNI

The graduates of Cornell now number 1,446. This small army of educated
men and women have scattered widely over all the states of the union
and to many foreign countries. They have entered many vocations. The
profession receiving the largest number is teaching. Of the 1,139
graduates including the class of 1905, reported in the catalog of 1908,
ninety-seven have been engaged in teaching in colleges and
universities, and 165 in secondary and normal schools. One hundred and
forty-nine have entered the law, and 139 have entered the ministry.
Business and banking were the employments of 113. Medicine has been the
choice of forty-nine, and engineering and architecture of fifty-two.
The foreign missionary field has claimed thirty-four, and social
service in charity organization societies, deaconess work, social
settlements, and the Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W. C. A. have engaged
twenty-six. Thirty-two have engaged in farming, and twenty-six in
newspaper work. The women graduates of the school very largely have
been induced to enter the profession of matrimony. Up to 1876, for
example, ninety per cent of the alumnae had married. Of later years the
larger opportunities for professional service, opening for women, and
no doubt other general causes, have decreased the percentage, but of
all women graduates up to the year 1900, seventy per cent have married.
Of these forty-two per cent have married graduates of the college. The
common error that college education lessens the opportunities of woman
for her natural vocation is disproved, at least so far as Cornell
college is concerned. The marriages of the graduates of Cornell have
been singularly fortunate. Among the more than 1,400 alumni, there has
been so far as known but two divorces. Considering the high percentages
of divorce in the states of the Union, rising as high in some states as
one divorce to every six marriages, the divorceless history of the
Cornell alumni witnesses the sociologic value of the Christian
co-educational college.

In numbers the graduating classes have steadily increased. The first
class, that of 1858, consisted of two members, Mr. and Mrs. Matthew
Cavanaugh, of Iowa City. Classes remained small, never exceeding five,
until the close of the Civil war when the young men who had entered the
service of their country, and who survived the war, returned to school.
In 1867 eleven were graduated, and in 1869 the class numbered
twenty-two. The last decade the graduating class from the college of
liberal arts has averaged sixty.


CORNELL AND THE WAR FOR THE UNION

President Charles W. Elliot, in one of his educational addresses, after
enumerating what the community must do for the college, asks, "And what
will the college do for the community? It will make rich returns of
learning, of poetry, and of piety, and of that fine sense of civic duty
without which republics are impossible." That Cornell has made all
these returns in ample measure is shown by the roster of the alumni
with its many eminent names in the service of state and church. More
than fifteen thousand young men and women have left the college halls
carrying with them for the enrichment of the community stores of
learning, poetic ideals of life, and vital piety. The fine sense of
civic duty which the college breeds finds special illustration in the
crisis of the Civil war, and here we may quote the eloquent words of
Colonel Harry H. Rood in an address delivered at the Semi-Centennial of
the college in 1904:

     "The first seven and a half years in the history of this
     college was a period of struggle and embarrassment. The
     spring of 1861 seemed to be the beginning of brighter days.
     A railway had brought it in touch with the outer world, and
     the effects of the great financial panic of 1857 were
     passing, enabling the sons and daughters of the pioneers to
     enter its halls to secure the education they so greatly
     desired. The sky of hope was quickly overcast, and the storm
     cloud of the Civil war, which had been gathering for half a
     century, burst over the land. The students of Cornell were
     not surprised or alarmed. The winter preceding they had
     organized a mock congress with every state represented, in
     which all the issues of the coming conflict were fully
     discussed and understood.... The first regiment the young
     state sent out to preserve the Union had in its ranks a
     company from this county--_one-third of the names upon its
     muster rolls were students from this school. The first full
     company to go from this township into the three years
     service had one-third of its membership from this college,
     and the second full company from the township, in 1862, also
     had an equal number of Cornell's patriotic sons._ In the
     great crisis of 1864, when President Lincoln asked for men
     to relieve the veteran regiments and permit them to go to
     the front, _almost a full company were college men_. In the
     class of 1861 only two men were graduated and both entered
     the service.... The record shows that from 1853 to 1871
     fifty-four men were graduated from the college, and of these
     thirty had worn the blue."

During the war the college had much the aspect of a female seminary to
which a few young boys and cripples had been admitted by courtesy. In
1863 but twelve male students were registered in college classes, and
at the commencement of this year all upon the program were women except
a delicate youth unfit for war and a boy of sixteen years. This
commencement was unique in the history of the college. On commencement
day the audience of peaceful folk seated in the grove quietly listening
to the student orations was suddenly transformed to an infuriated mob,
when one girl visitor attempted to snatch from another a copperhead pin
she was wearing. So strong was the excitement, that the college
buildings were guarded by night for some time afterward for fear that
they might be burned in revenge by sympathisers with the south.[L]

Near the close of the war it was seen that many of the soldier students
of the college would be unable to complete their education because of
the sacrifices they had made in the service of their country. A fund of
fourteen thousand dollars was therefore contributed by patriot friends
at home and in part by Iowa regiments in the field for the education of
disabled soldiers and soldiers' orphans. No gift to the school has ever
been more useful than this foundation, which aided in the support of
hundreds of the most worthy students of the college.

Two of the students of Cornell were enrolled in the armies of the
Confederacy. Of these one became a lieutenant in a Texas regiment. At
one time learning that one of his prisoners was a Cornell boy and a
member of his own literary society, the Texas lieutenant found Cornell
loyalty a stronger motive than official duty. He took his prisoner
several miles from camp, gave him a horse and started him for the Union
lines.


THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION

From the beginning Cornell college has been coeducational. In the
earliest years of her history some concessions were made in the courses
of study to the supposed weakness of woman's intellect, and "ornamental
branches," such as "Grecian painting," which seems to have been a sort
of transfer work, "ornamental hair work and wax flowers" were grafted
on the curriculum for her special benefit--branches which soon were
pruned away.

Woman's presence seems to have been regarded in these early years as a
menace to the social order, safely permitted only under the most
rigorous restrictions. So late as 1869 Rule Number Twelve appeared in
the catalog--"_The escorting of young ladies by young gentlemen is not
allowed_." This was a weak and degenerate offspring of the stern edict
of President Keeler's administration:

"_Young ladies and gentlemen will not associate together in walking or
riding nor stand conversing together in the halls or public rooms of
the buildings, but when necessary they can see the persons they desire
by permission._"

For many years these blue laws have been abrogated, and the only
restrictions found needful are those ordinarily imposed by good
society. The association and competition of young men and women in all
college activities--an association necessarily devoid of all romance
and glamour--has been found sane and helpful to both sexes, and no
policy of segregation in any form has ever been as much as suggested.

The social life of the college has always been under the leadership of
the literary societies. They are now eight in number: The Amphictyon,
Adelphian, Miltonian and Star for men and the Philomathean, Aesthesian,
Alethean and Aonian for women. The students of the Academy also sustain
four flourishing societies, the Irving and Gladstone, Clionian and
King.

These societies meet in large and rather luxuriously furnished halls in
which they entertain their friends each week with literary and musical
programs, followed by short socials. Business meetings offer thorough
drill in parliamentary practice and often give place to impromptu
debates which give facility in extemporaneous speaking. The societies
also give banquets and less formal receptions from time to time and in
general have charge of the social life of the school. Members are
chosen by election and the rushing of the incoming freshman class is a
fast and furious campaign, occupying a week or so of the first
half-year. However it may affect studies, it certainly develops
friendships and promotes the rapid assimilation of the large number of
new students in the body social of the school.

The societies have always been in effect fraternities and sororities so
far as social advantages are concerned, and they have performed the
function of the best fraternities in the intellectual and moral
supervision which they have given their members. But the literary
societies have been more than fraternities, and under their supervision
the social life of the college has been lived on a distinctly higher
plane than had its organization been purely social and for recreation
only. They have also been markedly distinguished from fraternities in
their democratic character. Instead of excluding fifty or even seventy
or eighty per cent of the students from their privileges, they have
given their inestimable social advantages to practically all who cared
to join them. They have thus prevented the growth of a leisured class
of students whose sole interest in college is found in its recreations
and who have been allowed the control of the college social life.
Indeed, so valuable in the history of the college has this social
organization proved that students have suggested that it be extended to
other colleges by means of affiliated chapters.


ENDOWMENTS

During the earlier years of its history the college received few
notable gifts. It was largely sustained by innumerable small
contributions to its current expenses and endowment funds made by
devoted friends whose generosity and self sacrifice deserve the praise
bestowed upon the widow who cast her mite into the treasury of the
temple. The larger gifts which have been made in endowing chairs, with
the amounts and dates of the foundation and names of the donors, are as
follows:

     1859 Hamline Professorship of Greek Language and Literature,
     $25,000, by Bishop L. L. Hamline.

     1873 D. N. Cooley Professorship of Civil and Sanitary
     Engineering, $10,000, by Hon. D. N. Cooley, Dubuque, and
     Oliver Hoyt.

     1873 Alumni Professorship of Mathematics, $50,000, by The
     Alumni.

     1885 W. F. Johnston Professorship of Physics, $50,000, by
     Hon. W. F. Johnston, Toledo.

     1902 Edgar Truman Brackett, Jr., Professorship of History
     and Politics, $30,000, by Hon. Edgar T. Brackett, Saratoga,
     N. Y.

     1904 David Joyce Professorship of Political Economy and
     Sociology, $50,000, by David Joyce, Clinton.

[Illustration: COMMERCIAL HOTEL, CENTER POINT]

[Illustration: BRIDGE OVER CEDAR RIVER AT CENTER POINT]

     1904 Lucy Hayes King Foundation, now in support of the
     presidency, by ex-president Wm. F. King, $50,000.

     1910 Alumni Professorship of Geology, $50,000, by The
     Alumni.

Among the other notable gifts to the college must be mentioned that by
the Hon. Andrew Carnegie, of $50,000 for the erection of the Carnegie
library, dedicated in 1905.

The largest donations to the college have been those of its president
emeritus, William Fletcher King. Most valuable of all have been the
long years of service, but besides these he has given from time to time
many financial gifts to meet current needs and near the end of his term
of office, he crowned his benefactions not only with the endowment of
the professorship just mentioned, but with the munificent gift of
$100,000 to found 100 scholarships in memory of Margaret Fletcher King.
At the unveiling of the bronze tablet in her memory, in 1904, Hon. L.
M. Shaw spoke these fitting words: "It is my privilege to witness the
unveiling of a tablet erected in memory of a saintly woman who came in
bridal clothes and left in cerements, and who spent the entire
thirty-eight years of her married life wedded as completely to Cornell
college as to William F. King, and who served both with equal
faithfulness and with unfaltering devotion. Words are inadequate to
measure the influence of a Christian woman's life spent amid
surroundings such as have existed here for a generation. Neither does
bronze suffice to prophesy the lift toward righteousness and higher
citizenship of what is here done by the bereaved husband in the name of
Margaret McKell King.... The tablet so thoughtfully erected to her
memory and the endowment of scholarships so generously made by Dr. King
guarantee the perpetuation of the sweet influence of a noble life and
extend the benison of Christian education to one hundred students per
annum, on and on, far beyond the ken of those who knew her and knowing
loved her."

In 1910 the general education board made a conditional gift to the
college of $100,000 for endowment, and of the $300,000 to be secured to
meet the conditions nearly half has already been promised in sums among
the largest ever given to the school.


THE CURRICULUM

In the fifties Cornell college was a very simple organization. In the
first year of the college as distinct from the seminary, six teachers
taught the entire round of the college course, which then included but
forty subjects, each pursued for but three months. Besides Latin, Greek
and mathematics, there were offered six terms in science and seven in
the following subjects: Natural Theology, Evidences of Christianity,
Moral Science, Butler's Analogy, Mental Philosophy, Rhetoric, and
Elements of Criticism. This simple curriculum was stated by the catalog
to embrace "the course of study in Mathematics, Languages, Sciences,
and Belle Lettres which is prescribed in the best colleges and
universities. It is thorough, extensive and systematic." All the same,
both Cornell and "the best colleges and universities" have found that
college courses could be made more "thorough and extensive" if not
"more systematic." Latin, for example, at Cornell now offers eleven
half-year courses instead of nine third-year courses as in 1857-1858.
Sciences, which then offered six terms, now offer thirty-seven
half-years and form five strong departments with their own professors
and assistants. In 1875 the department of English Literature was
organized, and the same year special teachers were employed for the
first time in public speaking, although the School of Oratory was not
organized until 1891. History and Politics became a distinct department
in 1886. Courses in the English Bible were offered in 1894, and in
Sociology in 1900. In all, the last catalog lists more than two hundred
half-year collegiate courses of study.

The college has been among the foremost in the west in adapting and
enlarging its courses to meet changing ideals. As early as 1873 the
department of Civil and Sanitary Engineering was organized, in which
hundreds of young men have received a valuable equipment for the work
of life. One of the earliest recognitions of education as a collegiate
subject was when courses in this science were offered at Cornell in
1872--the beginning of the present strong school of education. In 1900
and 1901 special directors of Physical Training for both men and women
were first employed.


SPIRIT AND INFLUENCE

During all these changing years since 1853 the spirit of Cornell has
remained essentially the same. It has made for scholarship--a
scholarship honest, tireless, and fearless in the search for truth; it
has cherished culture; it has fitted for service and has sent forth its
students to perform, in the words of Milton, "justly, skilfully, and
magnanimously all the duties both public and private of peace and war."
It has ever been a religious spirit, too, this spirit of Cornell, and
kindling in thousands of young hearts has inspired them to purer,
stronger, and more helpful living.

The influence of Cornell may be summarized by a quotation from an
editorial in the Cedar Rapids _Republican_ in 1904, reviewing the
history of the college:

     "Fifty years of college work and college building; what does
     it mean? What is it these men, about whom we have been
     writing, have done? The half can not be told. No research,
     however painstaking, could discover it all, for only a
     portion of such work is ever seen of men. For fifty years a
     constant stream of beneficent influences has been flowing
     out from this institution. The pure water which gushes from
     a spring on the hillsides, who can trace? A certain portion
     will refresh those who dwell near its source. The remainder
     flows away to form a brooklet that 'joins brimming river'
     which carries ships, waters cities, and finally augments an
     ocean current that washes illimitable shores. But for these
     springs the everlasting ocean would dry up. The stream of
     beneficent influences which has been flowing from this
     institution on the hillside down yonder, has been carried
     around the world--into countless fields of human activity
     and high endeavor--into homes where mothers teach their
     children to avoid those things that are of the earth
     earthy--into business establishments where the golden rule
     is not always turned toward the wall--into legislative halls
     where statesmen and patriots are needed--into the judiciary
     of state and nation--into the cabinet of the president of
     the United States--into all callings and all
     professions--into all countries and all climes. May it flow
     on forever and forever!"




CHAPTER XXIV

_History of Coe College_

BY REV. E. R. BURKHALTER, D. D.


There is an interest, and a charm peculiarly its own in tracing a
stream that has grown to be a river back to its head waters in some
lake or mountain spring. And when instead of a river we trace backward
a college to its source and fountain head, this interest and charm come
to possess a sacred value and are full of hallowed associations. And
the charm and interest become complete when this matter is pursued by
one who is not only a historian but also a participant in the
transactions which cover years of time and call up many holy and tender
memories of scenes and places, and yet more, of persons who were
fellow-workers in the good cause and the most of whom have passed from
earth.

The fountain head of Coe College, whose history it is now proposed to
record, is to be sought and found in the mind and heart of the Rev.
Williston Jones, the pioneer pastor of Cedar Rapids, who for the years
between 1849 and 1856 was the minister of the First Presbyterian church
of this city. Mr. Jones was a most zealous servant of his Divine
Master, and labored zealously for His cause, not only in the local
field, which was then so newly opened for settlement, but in the whole
outlying region. His heart felt the needs of this entire middle west,
which, as a fertile wilderness, was offering such inducements for the
pioneer settler, and he longed to do his part to the utmost in
assisting to provide this region with a gospel ministry. To this end,
he opened a School of the Prophets in his own home.

We now avail ourselves at this early point of our history of the
valuable contributions furnished by the words of the Rev. George R.
Carroll, in his most interesting little volume entitled _Pioneer Life
in and Around Cedar Rapids, 1839-1849_.

     "Mr. Jones had persuaded one young man, the writer of this
     sketch, to devote his life to the gospel ministry. But there
     was no school here in which he could begin his studies. At
     last the zealous pastor decided to undertake himself the
     task of preparing that young man for college. Meantime,
     other young men heard of the arrangement, and persuaded Mr.
     Jones to admit them also to the same privileges. The result
     was the formation of a class of sixteen or eighteen young
     men who occupied the unfurnished parlor in the pastor's
     house, which was temporarily fitted up for the purpose. One
     of the number was chosen to act as monitor each week, and
     Mr. and Mrs. Jones came in at different hours of the day to
     hear the recitations in the various branches of study
     pursued. The branches studied were reading, writing,
     geography, arithmetic, Latin and Greek. This school
     continued its regular sessions for about six months, and was
     successfully wound up with a public exhibition under the
     shade trees in front of the pastor's residence on the hill
     near the Milwaukee depot. The following young men were among
     the students of that first school: George Weare, John Stony,
     Cyrus E. Ferguson, Murry S. D. Davis, Amos Ferguson, Isaac
     W. Carroll, Mortimer A. Higley, William E. Earl, William J.
     Wood, Edwin Kennedy, George R. Carroll, James L. Bever, and
     George W. Bever."

We also avail ourselves of an extract from the _Fortieth Anniversary
First Presbyterian Church, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 1887_, on which occasion
Mr. Carroll in his biographical sketch of the Rev. Williston Jones, our
first pastor, used the following language:

     "Mr. Jones was deeply interested in the subject of raising
     up a native ministry. That is to say, he believed that it
     was important that we should seek out young men from among
     the people of the west to labor in the west. It was,
     therefore, his constant aim wherever he met a Christian
     young man of any promise, to lay before him the claims of
     the gospel ministry, and urge him prayerfully to consider
     the question as to whether or not God had called him to the
     sacred office. This fact, of course, led him to take a great
     interest in the subject of education. There were no schools
     at that time where a young man could even begin a course of
     study for the ministry. He felt the embarrassment of the
     situation. He had at last found one young man who had
     decided to study for the ministry, but there was no school
     in Cedar Rapids where he could make a beginning of the study
     of Latin or Greek or any of the higher branches of study. At
     last he decided to undertake himself the task of preparing
     that young man for college. In a short time, a dozen or
     fifteen more, hearing of this arrangement, begged the
     privilege of joining that lone student in studying under Mr.
     Jones, and before he was aware of it, he found himself at
     the head of a school for young men. This was in the autumn
     of 1851. He had erected for himself, meantime, a house of
     the same material of the old church, cement. It still stands
     on the hill north of the Milwaukee depot. The parlor of that
     house was at that time unfinished. It was lathed but not
     plastered. Mr. Jones said to the young men, if they would
     get one coat of plastering put onto that room, and put in
     some temporary seats made of slabs, they could have the use
     of it for a school room. The offer was promptly accepted,
     and, in due time, the school began in good earnest. One of
     the number would act as monitor in the school-room for a
     week, and then another, until the honor had been enjoyed by
     all. Mr. and Mrs. Jones were the first professors of the
     institution, coming in at regular hours to hear recitations.
     The branches of study pursued in the new academy were
     reading, writing, geography, arithmetic, algebra, grammar,
     Latin and Greek. Due attention was also given to
     composition, declamation, and vocal music. For six months
     that school continued in perfect harmony and marked success.
     The term closed sometime in June, I think 1852, with public
     exercises appropriate to the occasion. The place of meeting
     was in a grove immediately in front of the school-room. The
     order of exercises, as nearly as I can remember, consisted
     in singing and prayer of course, recitations, reading of
     essays, and declamations. Everything passed off pleasantly
     and satisfactorily, and I believe the school was pronounced
     a success. This effort convinced Mr. Jones more than ever of
     the need of a permanent school of a higher order. He
     therefore wrote on to Knox college, I think to Professor
     Blanchard, to see if one of the graduates could not come and
     take charge of the school. The result was that Mr. David
     Blakely, then a recent graduate of Knox college, came in the
     fall of 1852 and opened the school in the church. The school
     then assumed the name of the Cedar Rapids Collegiate
     Institute. Mr. Blakely held the position of principal of
     that school for two years, and then resigned his position to
     enter the active work of the gospel ministry, in which he is
     still engaged. During all this time the school was kept up
     with unabated interest, many students coming in from the
     country round about, and several from remote parts of the
     state. At least three of the members of that school entered
     the ministry, and are still engaged in the active duties of
     the sacred calling: one. Rev. Hiram Hill, in California;
     another, Rev. William Campbell, in Kansas; and the third in
     this state. It was during the spring of 1853, I think, that
     Mr. Jones was sent as a commissioner to the General Assembly
     (N. S.) which met in Buffalo, N. Y. During his absence the
     school at home occupied his thoughts and called out all the
     energies of his ardent nature. He determined if possible to
     secure aid in the east by which to place the school upon a
     permanent basis, having for its chief end the education of
     indigent young men for the gospel ministry. He was not
     disappointed in his purpose. Guided no doubt by an all-wise
     Providence, he met Mr. Daniel Coe, who listened to his
     earnest appeal, and gave him the money with which the eighty
     acres of ground, where the college now stands, and these two
     lots now occupied by this church and chapel, and a lot now
     occupied by the M. E. church, were secured, Dr. J. F. Ely
     making the purchase. You will see then, that out of the
     little school, started in the first pastor's house, has
     grown Coe college, and Rev. Williston Jones was its
     founder."

[Illustration: W. F. KING, LL. D. Long President Cornell College]

It can thus be easily seen that the yearning of Mr. Jones to see a
school provided in Cedar Rapids was a fire in his bones. And so, when
in the providence of God, he was in attendance at a meeting of the
General Assembly of the Presbyterian church (New School) which was held
in May, 1853, in the city of Buffalo, N. Y., he sought to interest
everyone whom he met in the cause of Christian education in the west.
At that same session of the General Assembly was a minister of the
Presbyterian church from the Catskill mountain region of New York
state. He said to Mr. Jones, in substance. "I cannot help you myself,
but I believe I know a man in my section of the country who can and
will, and if you come home with me to Durham, Greene county, New York,
I will introduce you to him." The man alluded to was Mr. Daniel Coe, an
elder of the church, already deeply interested in the cause of
Christian education and preparing to help according to his ability when
the suitable opportunity was afforded.

Mr. Jones went to Durham and met Mr. Coe, and presenting to him the
matter nearest to his heart, the founding of a school of christian
learning in the new world beyond the Mississippi. Mr. Coe gladly
consented to assist in the enterprise. The sum promised, $1,500, would
be considered in these days a very meagre one, but in 1853, and in
Iowa, it must have seemed like $15,000 or more would seem now to us,
and Mr. Jones must have welcomed the proffered aid with delight.

When he returned to his home in Cedar Rapids and to his brethren of the
Presbytery of Iowa City, of which he was a member, he made such
encouraging statements concerning the treatment he had received at the
General Assembly, and especially concerning the offer of Mr. Coe, that
there was formed in Cedar Rapids a corporation by the name of the Cedar
Rapids Collegiate Institute, which prepared articles and filed them for
record August 9, 1853. All persons owning one share of stock each in
the Institute became thereby members of the corporation, each share of
stock being of the value of $25.00. Article twelve of the fourteen
articles of corporation reads as follows:

"The Iowa City Presbytery in consideration of five scholarships for the
first five years, and of ten scholarships thereafter, shall have the
right to nominate all teachers of the Institute, subject, however, to
confirmation by the Board of Directors, but this right shall be
forfeited if said consideration should at any time fail."

There is no reason to suppose from the records that this consideration
was ever fulfilled.

Article thirteen gives the names of the directors: Williston Jones,
John F. Ely, W. W. Smith, Seymour D. Carpenter, Addison Daniels, Isaac
Cook, William Greene, John L. Shearer, and Aaron Van Dorn; and the
following persons as officers of the board: George Greene, president;
Samson C. Bever, treasurer; David Blakely, secretary.

It is very interesting to note that of these persons there is one who
survives to this day, Mr. W. W. Smith, who at a very advanced age still
lives at Minneapolis.

The first meeting of this board of directors was held July 18, 1853,
and it was at that meeting that Mr. Jones presented the instrument of
writing signed by Daniel Coe, of the county of Greene, in the state of
New York, making a conditional donation to the Institute of the sum of
$1,500, of which the following is a copy:

"CONDITIONAL DONATION TO CEDAR RAPIDS COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE

     "Know all men by these presents that I, Daniel Coe, of the
     town of Durham, County of Greene, and State of New York, in
     view of the educational wants of the great and growing West,
     and in expectation of its resulting in the establishment of
     a permanent institution of learning, do hereby engage to
     give in behalf of Iowa City Presbytery, connected with the
     constitutional General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church
     which met at Buffalo, May 19th, 1853, to Cedar Rapids
     Collegiate Institute the following sums for the object
     hereinafter specified, to-wit: Four Hundred and twenty-five
     Dollars ($425.00) for the purchase of as large and suitable
     tract of land as practicable as a site for the location of
     the institute. And Seventy-five Dollars ($75.00) for fencing
     of the same. Also One Thousand Dollars ($1000.00) to be
     appropriated in the best manner for a farm contiguous to the
     site, the avails of which are to be appropriated to the best
     advantage for the benefit of such students as may need to
     assist themselves by manual labor. Of these two sums the
     first mentioned, consisting of Five Hundred Dollars
     ($500.00), can be secured to the Institute as a part of its
     property by the erection upon its site thus purchased of a
     building costing at least Two Thousand Dollars ($2000.00),
     and the last mentioned One Thousand Dollars ($1000.00) can
     be thus secured by bringing the Institute into successful
     operation. _Provided_ that if these conditions fail, or if
     the Institute be removed or diverted from its original
     design, either or both of these donations shall be
     forfeited, and the land purchased shall revert back to the
     said Daniel Coe, his heirs, executors, or administrators.

     "Dr. John F. Ely, Hon. George Greene, Dr. S. D. Carpenter,
     Isaac Cook, Esq., James Ferguson, and Williston Jones are
     hereby authorized to act for me in the selection and
     purchasing for said Institute the above mentioned site and
     farm, and are to draw on me for the money; of which sum
     Seven Hundred Dollars ($700.00) can be drawn at any time,
     and the remaining Eight Hundred Dollars ($800.00) one year
     from the date of this engagement.

     "It is my strong desire that this Institute should be made
     available for the education of females as well as males."

It is evidently to be seen that it was the purpose of Mr. Coe to enable
the directors of the Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute to maintain a
school of learning to be conducted in a building within easy access to
the town, and at the same time aid such students as needed assistance
through the products of the farm purchased on the edge of the town.
Steps were taken at once to procure two sites, one for the school
building, the other for the farm. And after considerable inquiry and
debate, two sites were chosen and purchased: the one for the school
building consisting of the two lots on which the First Presbyterian
church of this city now stands and has stood since 1869; the other for
the farm, consisting of a plot of eighty acres, of which the present
campus of Coe College of ten acres, is the southwestern extremity.

The town lots were purchased for $275.00. The eighty acres were bought
for $1000.00. These eighty acres were obtained from Mr. Otho S. Bowling
by Dr. John F. Ely, who bought them with Mr. Coe's money for the Cedar
Rapids Collegiate Institute. The date of the purchase is December 5,
1853. Mr. Bowling had obtained the land at the price of $820.00 from
the executors of the estate of Mr. Joshua Phillips, of Franklin county,
Pennsylvania. Mr. Phillips had died at his residence in Pennsylvania
at some time between the 15th of December, 1852, and the 4th of
January, 1853, and he had himself obtained the property in Cedar Rapids
by patent from the United States government May 1, 1848. So that the
plot of ground which figures in such a vital manner in the history of
Coe College had passed through but two hands before being transferred
to the Collegiate Institute from the government which had obtained it
from the Indians.

It has also appeared that it was the wish of Mr. Coe and the design of
the directors of the school that the building to cost $2000.00 should
be erected as soon as practicable upon the town lots. But the erection
of this building was delayed for various causes and especially in
consequence of the lack of funds. Meanwhile, a school of very
elementary character was maintained in the building used as their house
of worship by the First Presbyterian church, and Mr. David Blakely was
obtained as principal at a salary of $400.00 per annum, payable
quarterly.

As time went on it was found to be more difficult than seemed probable
in the beginning, to obtain subscriptions for the erection of the
building of a school of just the character that seemed within the
feeble means of the directors. And it became even more difficult, if
not impossible, to maintain the school in the building occupied by the
Presbyterian church. For it would appear that this community of Cedar
Rapids was in process of organizing a general public school system, and
no place seemed to exist for a parochial school of the elementary
character that was then being conducted by the Cedar Rapids Collegiate
Institute, at least in so small a community and one so feebly provided
with material funds.

Therefore, through the want of proper sustenance, everyone connected
with the Institute and notably the principal upon whom the chief burden
fell became wholly discouraged and the Presbytery of Iowa City, that
had a certain relationship to the school and interest in its success,
proposed to put the school on wheels and offer it to the highest
bidder, naming several localities among which were: Vinton, Waterloo,
Lyons, Cedar Falls, Newton, and Iowa City.[M]

It will surely be of interest to learn [See _Minutes Iowa City
Presbytery_, Mt. Vernon, February 4, 1857] that the citizens and
proprietors of Comanche offered a site and subscriptions to the amount
of $10,000, or $200.00 more than any other town, for the location of
the Collegiate Institute of the Presbytery. Vinton also made a strong
bid for the school and hoped to capture it, and might have done so had
it not been that the eighty acre plot of ground, which was the only
financial asset of the institution, was securely fastened down in Cedar
Rapids, and Mr. Coe hesitated as to the propositions for the removal of
the school.

But these internal and external discussions acted in a very unfavorable
manner upon the Institute, and led to the winding up of its affairs,
for there is no record of any meeting of its board of directors
subsequent to July 26, 1859.

Meanwhile, a new star of hope arose in the heavens, and for several
years at least it was a star of considerable brilliancy. It was made
known, namely, that the will of Mr. Lewis Baldwin Parsons, a benefactor
and philanthropist, and who died in Detroit, Michigan, December 21,
1855, after a successful life as a manufacturer in Buffalo, N. Y.,
contained a bequest setting aside a very considerable amount of money
to found a Presbyterian college in Iowa. It could not be a matter of
surprise, therefore, that the brethren in Cedar Rapids, who had
struggled so hard to found a college with Mr. Coe's donation, and who
had been so sorely disappointed, should now with enthusiasm welcome the
thought that the Parsons legacy might be located here and be added to
the Coe donation, and thus become the foundation of a strong college in
Iowa in connection with the Presbyterian church. Accordingly, steps
were taken to incorporate a new body of stockholders into an
organization to be known as Parsons Seminary. The date of the first
meeting with this end in view is November 10, 1866, and the following
persons were chosen to serve as officers until the annual meeting in
December: Rev. James Knox, president; Hon. George Greene,
vice-president; Dr. John F. Ely, secretary; and Mr. S. C. Bever,
treasurer.

At the annual meeting, December 3, 1866, the following officers were
chosen: George Greene, president; James Knox, vice-president; John F.
Ely, secretary; W. W. Walker, treasurer.

It was resolved immediately that Mr. Coe should be requested to deed to
the new organization the eighty acres of land already donated by him to
the Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute, and at a meeting of the board of
trustees of Parsons Seminary, held January 4, 1867, Judge Greene,
president of the board, reported that he had visited Mr. Daniel Coe at
his home in Durham, N. Y., and had procured from him the deed to
Parsons Seminary of the land in question.

This most generous act of Mr. Coe reveals the large and unselfish
character of the man and declares the nobility of his motive to promote
the cause of high christian education in the west.

This act of Mr. Coe also gave great encouragement to the board of
trustees of the seminary to proceed in their work, and they proceeded
vigorously to raise what must in those days have been a considerable
sum of money, for the purpose of erecting a suitable building for
college purposes upon the edge of the eighty acre plot nearest to the
town. The two town lots which had originally been purchased for the
location of the school building were sold to the trustees of the First
Presbyterian church, to become the site of a house of worship, which
building was erected by them in 1869, and still stands a substantial
edifice of stone, facing the public square long known as Washington
Park, now George Greene Square.

The ways and means and plans for this new building occupied the
attention of the board for many meetings during the years 1867 and
1868, and the work was pushed with all vigor to enable the trustees to
open their seminary in the new building in the fall of 1868.

Meanwhile, the school work was inaugurated, pending the erection of the
building on the college grounds, in the Wadsworth block, a row of
unpretentious buildings resembling a barracks, on Second street and
Fifth avenue, in the school year 1867-8. The principal of this school
was the Rev. A. B. Goodale, a Presbyterian clergyman who survived in
southern California until a few years ago.

Mr. Charles J. Deacon, our highly esteemed and greatly respected fellow
citizen, who has spent a long and useful life among us, as an attorney,
and who has been for several years a most valuable trustee of Coe
College, was one of the first students of Parsons Seminary, and he has
furnished us the following reminiscences which we gladly incorporate in
this historical sketch:

     "I came to Cedar Rapids and enrolled as a student in Parsons
     Seminary early in September, 1868. The school had been in
     progress under that name for a year previous, but then for
     the first time entered into the new building, now the west
     half of the main building of Coe college. This school was
     then prosperous and the body of students very enthusiastic.
     Dr. A. B. Goodale was the principal and Prof. Augustus
     Maasburg was the professor of Latin, Greek, French, and
     German. Miss A. D. Kelsey, a graduate of Mt. Holyoke, and a
     most estimable lady, had charge of the primary department,
     and also taught many of the classes in mathematics, and had
     charge of the botany class. Miss Lindsay, a sister of Mrs.
     Goodale, taught painting and drawing. A few weeks after the
     school opened, Professor and Madame Masurier came, and
     Professor Masurier took charge of the music, and Mme.
     Masurier was given the care of the French class. I remember
     also that Miss Addie Goodell, now Mrs. Birdsall, of Lake
     City, Iowa, was a student in the seminary, and it became
     necessary to have an assistant in the primary department,
     and she was employed in that capacity.

[Illustration: MAIN STREET FROM THE NORTH, FAIRFAX]

[Illustration: MAIN STREET LOOKING WEST, CENTRAL CITY]

     "At the beginning of the year 1868-1869 the school numbered
     over one hundred students. They were, of course, largely
     from the city of Cedar Rapids, but they came also from the
     surrounding towns of Fairfax, Springville, Center Point,
     Central City, and some from the farms within a few miles of
     the city. They came also from Vinton and Marengo, and some
     from more distant portions of the state, and I remember two
     from the state of Illinois, and one from Nebraska.

     "The school year was divided into four terms of ten weeks
     each, the tuition being $7.50 per term. I remember there was
     some falling off in the attendance at the close of the
     second term in mid-winter. In the spring we were told that
     Dr. Goodale would have an assistant in the person of Mr. J.
     W. Stephens. When he came he was introduced to us by Dr.
     Goodale as his assistant, but it soon developed that he was
     the principal of the seminary, Doctor Goodale having about
     that time accepted the pastorate of the Presbyterian church
     at Marshalltown. The attendance at the spring term under the
     conduct of Dr. Stephens was much smaller than in the fall,
     but the school continued until the 20th of June, when it
     closed for the summer vacation. It issued a catalogue as it
     had the previous year and announced the opening for the
     following September.

     "I returned to the school in the fall when it opened for the
     third year, being the second year in the new building, and
     found many of the old students. The school, however, was
     much smaller than at the opening of the previous year. It
     also dwindled very much during the year, and when we closed
     in June, 1870, my recollection is that it numbered about
     forty students. Mr. Stephens announced that it would be
     continued, however, and the school opened again in the
     September following. I did not return to the school, but
     went to the State University of Iowa. Mr. Stephens continued
     the school until the following spring, and then closed it.
     [We understand that Mr. Stephens is still living in
     connection with Park College, Mo.]

     "One thing that is quite clearly impressed upon my memory is
     the meeting of the Synod of Iowa, North, in this city in the
     late winter or early spring of 1869. The application of the
     Parsons legacy and the endowment of the college was then a
     very prominent question in Presbyterian circles. Cedar
     Rapids was a most prominent applicant for the location of
     the college to be thus endowed, and the seminary had been
     named Parsons Seminary with a view to attracting that legacy
     here. A large representation of the synod visited the
     college at the time I speak of and addressed the students.
     Amongst others, I remember Doctor Spees, then of Dubuque;
     the Rev. Samuel Howe, and Mr. Alexander Danskin, of Marengo.
     They said to us that we were now a college, that whereas
     yesterday we were a seminary, today we were a college. There
     was much enthusiasm manifested among us by this statement,
     and we all felt satisfied that the matter had been
     practically settled. Subsequent facts proved that their
     statement was a little premature.

     "Another thing that comes to my recollection is the visit of
     the committee to locate the Parsons legacy in the spring of
     1870. This committee was headed by Doctor Craig, then pastor
     of the church at Keokuk, now of McCormick Seminary, Chicago.
     The committee made a very thorough examination of the
     buildings and of the grounds and of the location generally.
     I distinctly recall their walking over the grounds. The
     trustees of the seminary, being informed in advance of the
     coming of this committee, were preparing to create a good
     impression. A few days before their expected arrival, the
     ground, which had been leveled off in front of the college,
     and which consisted of coarse sand, was ornamented by some
     fifty or sixty evergreen trees, and a large amount of black
     dirt was hauled in upon the sand with the expectation of
     spreading it over the sand to present a surface of good soil
     with a large number of evergreen trees set out in an
     ornamental order. Unfortunately, however, the committee
     arrived earlier than was anticipated and the black dirt had
     not been spread over the sand. To render the situation still
     worse, a high wind was blowing the day the committee were
     here and the sand was drifting over the dirt piles and
     filling up against the lower board of the fence. What the
     effect of this was upon the committee I have no means of
     judging. It is, however, interesting to notice that the
     Parsons legacy never came to Cedar Rapids.

     "I could mention many names of Cedar Rapids citizens who as
     boys attended school at Parsons Seminary during those early
     years. Mr. C. C. Greene, Mr. John S. Ely, Mr. George B.
     Douglas, were all there with me. Mr. George W. Winn, also a
     trustee, used to go there for private lessons in German from
     Professor Maasburg. Mr. C. L. Miller, of the _Gazette_,
     Emery and Harry Brown, and Elmer Higley are names that also
     occur to me readily. I could mention, likewise, many ladies
     who studied there in those early years. The Rev. Alexander
     Danskin, editor of one of our church papers at Detroit,
     Michigan, was a student there at that time, afterwards
     graduating from Wabash College; also the Rev. R. M. L.
     Braden, who likewise went to Wabash College.

     "These are a few of the things that come to my mind as I
     review my two years in Parsons Seminary."

It can easily be read between the lines of Mr. Deacon's reminiscences
that Parsons Seminary, however enthusiastic its support was at the
beginning, did not continue by any means to be an entire success. We
must look for the explanation of this very largely to its lack of
financial resources. It was living largely on hopes, and hopes that
were not destined to be realized. Mr. Coe's donation, lying in the
eighty acres of land, was utterly unproductive of a revenue, and the
Parsons legacy, which consisted of four thousand acres of wild lands in
various counties in Iowa, had not yet been located in Cedar Rapids, but
was hovering in the air as a glittering object which several localities
in the state were reaching out to obtain.

It would be an interesting and instructive pursuit to trace the history
of this legacy both within the Presbyterian synod of Iowa and within
the various cities of the state which made bids for its attainment. The
story, as far as Cedar Rapids is concerned, is one of bright hopes,
earnest aspiration, valiant endeavor and achievement, to be followed by
severe disappointment and bitter regret. The citizens of this city went
heroically to work to raise the sum of $75,000 to be subscribed and
added to the Parsons legacy [then estimated to be of the value of
$50,000], and this again to be added to the Coe donation of eighty
acres of land, which were continually increasing in value through the
growth of the city of Cedar Rapids. These three sums, when added
together, would furnish, it was intelligently felt, a very substantial
endowment as the beginning of a college. We have often been told that
when this campaign for the raising of the $75,000 had been successfully
completed, there was such a general jubilee in our city that
instinctively in demonstration thereof the whistles of the locomotives
and manufacturing establishments were merrily blown. But all these
plans went agley. Although committees from the synods of Iowa had
presented unanimous reports recommending that the Parsons legacy be
located at Cedar Rapids, it was eventually taken to Fairfield to found
Parsons College. The fund of $75,000 which was raised in Cedar Rapids
fell to the ground because of the failure to meet its vital condition
of the bringing of the Parsons legacy here, and so, once more, all that
was left for us was Mr. Coe's donation of the eighty acre plot and the
indomitable spirit of a few of the citizens of Cedar Rapids to plant in
our city an institution of higher learning in connection with the
Presbyterian church.

It is idle at this late date to discuss the wisdom or the folly of
those men in the synod who were responsible for this result. It were
wholly unproductive to speculate what might have been accomplished by
the union of all our educational forces here in Cedar Rapids. What is
written is written, what is done is an accomplished fact. Presbyterians
are not in the habit of quarreling with Divine Providence, but are the
rather given to rejoicing in the sovereignty of God. It is quite
conceivable that results already visible can give occasion for
gratitude that we have now the two colleges, Coe and Parsons, instead
of but one, as was once so ardently hoped for here at Cedar Rapids. If
anyone in the years between 1870 and 1873 made an error in judgment in
objecting to the merger, the only way to rectify it now is by pressing
all the more for the promoting of the endowment and the buildings of
both the colleges, the one at Fairfield, and the one at Cedar Rapids.

But the facts are that through the force of circumstances, the school
at Cedar Rapids was obliged to suspend its work, and little or nothing
was done in the building erected in 1868 from 1871 to 1875. Then for
the third time, and under new auspices, was the work begun afresh, and
it took place on this wise: On the 26th of April, 1875, the trustees of
Parsons Seminary held a meeting, at which meeting a committee of the
Presbytery of Cedar Rapids was present for the purpose of consulting
with the board to the end that the seminary building and the Coe legacy
located at Cedar Rapids might be made available for the establishment
of a school of a high order under the care of the said Presbytery. This
committee had been appointed by the Presbytery at its session at
Anamosa April 24, 1875, and they presented to the board of trustees of
Parsons Seminary a formal report in writing, which expressed the
readiness of the Presbytery to undertake the care of the school at
Cedar Rapids on condition that all its debts be cancelled, and its
charter be so amended as to give to the Presbytery the power to appoint
its board of trustees. The Presbytery also pledged itself to do all in
its power to maintain the school and open it in the school building by
the 1st of October, 1875. The board of trustees consented to the
proposition of the Presbytery and resolved to change the name of the
institution from Parsons Seminary to Coe Collegiate Institute. The
articles of incorporation of Parsons Seminary, which had been adopted
October 30, 1866, were amended May 11, 1875, to meet the new
conditions. The board of trustees was fixed at the number of eighteen,
and the power to elect them was vested in the Presbytery of Cedar
Rapids, or in the synod of Iowa North, if the said synod shall assume
such power with the consent of said Presbytery. The first election was
appointed to take place in the fall of the year 1876.

Mr. Daniel Coe had passed from earth in the interval between December
23, 1866, when he deeded the eighty acres of land in Cedar Rapids to
Parsons Seminary, and this date in 1875, when these new relations with
the seminary were entered into. He left a daughter, an only child, who
had become the wife of Mr. J. E. Jewell. This daughter, Mr. Coe's sole
heir at law, with her husband, entered in a very friendly manner and
measure into the new plans of the institution, and nobly agreed to
permit the school to avail itself under certain conditions well
understood and agreed to, of the advantages accruing from the revenues
of the property.

On the 21st of September, 1875, it was announced at a meeting of the
trustees of Coe Collegiate Institute that correspondence had been
conducted with the Rev. R. A. Condit with a view to his being made
principal of the school. Mr. Condit was then elected to that office.
This event marks the entrance into the work of Coe College of a
personality of rare value in himself and of rare value to the
institution of learning which he served most faithfully for a period of
thirty years after his appointment in 1875. Robert Aaron Condit was a
man of sweet spirit and gentle demeanor; he was a Christian and a
scholar. No one ever doubted his piety or his moral integrity. The
students who for a whole generation passed under his care all loved him
because he loved them, and was himself so lovable. His influence upon
them was mild, but effective, and we venture to say without fear of
contradiction, that all the alumni of Coe College who knew him as their
preceptor recognize the fact with gratitude that they are better
persons for having known him. In the weak and struggling days of Coe
Collegiate Institute before it emerged into its present larger,
stronger growth, as Coe College, Robert Condit was a factor peculiarly
fitted for the task providentially laid upon him, and his full value to
the college can scarcely be over-estimated or even stated sufficiently.

On the 8th of March, 1876, Prof. J. W. McLaury was employed to assist
Mr. Condit in the school, his salary being raised by voluntary
subscriptions. Mr. McLaury's services, though valuable, were not long
retained by the institution.

At the meeting of the board held December 28, 1876, the report of the
election of the trustees by the Presbytery October 4, 1876, was made,
as directed by the charter. And at the same meeting the following
officers of the board were chosen: Hon. George Greene, president;
Thomas M. Sinclair, vice president; D. W. C. Rowley, secretary; George
W. Winn, treasurer. It was at this meeting that the present writer took
his seat with his brethren for the first time as an officially
accredited member of the board. And it is a matter of grateful, tender
recollection to him, that he has remained to this day in unbroken
relation with the institution in all possible varieties of official
position and duties upon its manifold committees. And it is a solemn
recollection with him that he alone remains on the board of all those
who have served with him for thirty-four years.

He can well remember the tone and atmosphere of the meetings of the
board, which he was then called upon to attend. It was truly a day of
small things. The meetings were frequent and they were often lengthy,
and we must truly say they were usually dreary, and we went from them
with depressed hearts. For the questions for discussion were mostly,
not how to promote high christian learning, but how to pay the debts of
Parsons Seminary. And the problem was, how to pay something with
nothing. There were notes at two of the leading banks of the city,
notes which were increasing fearfully by the compounding of interest at
ten per cent, and there were notes held by individuals who had loaned
money to the seminary, there were mechanic's liens of sums unpaid in
the erection of the building put up in 1867-8, and to meet these
obligations there was nothing in sight. For all moneys that found their
way into the treasury were needed, and more than needed, to pay current
bills to teachers, heating and lighting bills and such minor fees. We
remember that our treasurer was once garnisheed by the brother of one
of our teachers for the payment of his sister's salary, and some sort
of compromise settlement was effected.

We have not a thought or word of disparagement concerning any member of
the board at that time. But it would have required men of heroic mold
and prophetic vision to face those problems. The president of the
board, the Hon. George Greene, a name never to be mentioned in this
city without a tribute of respect, was deeply immersed in his own
private interests and was compelled to be absent from home a great part
of the time. Soon after the date of which we speak, he insisted upon
pressing his resignation as president of the board. Other prominent
business and professional men on the board were also engrossed in large
personal interests. The ministers on the board, however valuable though
they may have been for counsel concerning educational questions, were
quite helpless in grappling with the financial problems which from
necessity were uppermost.

The Rev. James Knox had passed from earth October 10, 1875, after
having contributed valuable services to the college during the eleven
years of his pastorate in this city. We here insert the following
tribute to Mr. Knox, which was presented at a meeting of the board of
trustees March 8, 1876, and was adopted, all the members present
standing:

     "In the providence of God the Rev. James Knox, former vice
     president of this board, having been removed by death we
     take this opportunity to record our testimony to his
     exceeding worth as a man and his wisdom and faithfulness as
     a minister of the gospel, and to his great devotion and
     usefulness to this institution, having been connected with
     it from its earliest days, and having given to it his best
     strength and ability for many years, and his very latest
     prayers. We feel that his place cannot easily be filled and
     that in him the college has lost one of its truest and best
     friends."

There was one notable exception to all these. One personality stands
out from the midst of his brethren and to him more than to any other
element at this critical period of the history of Coe College do we
attribute the fact that we have a college today, and one with such
promise and potency. We refer to Mr. Thomas M. Sinclair. Mr. Sinclair
had come to Cedar Rapids in 1871 a young man not quite thirty years of
age. He was pursuing a large manufacturing business, that of pork
packing, with rare energy and intelligence, and with great success. He
was making money, and his great desire and single aim was to use this
money with a keen sense of responsibility to God and usefulness to his
fellow men. He was a man of rare christian character, one among ten
thousand. It may truly be said of him that he walked with God. Coming
into this young country from the older world, he took a most keenly
active interest in all things that pertained to its welfare, and it was
a fortunate thing for Coe College that he came to Cedar Rapids at such
a time as he did. The cause of christian education was one of his most
treasured conceptions of opportunity, and he identified himself with
the representative of that cause which he providentially found to his
hand in this struggling institution.

Seeing the imperative need of relief from debt which Coe Collegiate
Institute manifested, he determined in the nobility of his heart that
he would pay out of his own pocket such obligations, principal and
interest, as lay against the institution, although they amounted to
several thousand dollars. And this he gladly did in all such cases as
he could not induce those who owned these obligations to cancel them
themselves. And thus it came about one happy day that he could declare
the college was actually free from all such incumbrances. Then he and
several of his colleagues, inspired with new hope and courage, and
determined to launch the institution upon broader and deeper waters,
went before the synod of Iowa North, which met at Waterloo, Iowa, in
October, 1880, and asked the synod to assume the care and control of
the Institute, free from debt, and possessed of a building, and of
eighty acres of land in the city of Cedar Rapids. The synod accepted
the proposition, and steps were taken at once to frame articles of
incorporation of a new organization to be called Coe College. The
articles were filed for record on the 16th day of April, 1881. Proper
deeds were drawn and filed for record which conveyed to Coe College all
the properties owned by Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute, Parsons
Seminary, and Coe Collegiate Institute, and thus the line of
inheritance and descent was duly established. In these negotiations
relating to the transference of the property through the hands of Mr.
and Mrs. Jewell, negotiations which required great care in the
handling, the valuable services of Mr. A. V. Eastman should be
mentioned. Mr. Eastman served the college most valuably for several
years at this period as its secretary. He subsequently removed from
Cedar Rapids to St. Paul, Minn., and still later to St. Charles, La.,
where he died most suddenly several years ago.

We have now emerged with our history from the intricacies of a somewhat
tortuous channel, and we have passed out from shoals and shallows to
enter upon clearer, deeper, broader waters. Henceforth we are to pursue
the story of the institution known as Coe College, which, with devious
fortunes, but with perceptibly increasing volume, has been filling its
place and doing its work under the charter prepared in 1881. Certain
changes have been made to this charter, more or less important, but
Coe College is the same institution, conducted by the same
incorporation from 1881 to the present time.

The first item which we are called upon to record at this period of the
history of our college, is the lamentable death of Mr. Thomas M.
Sinclair, which occurred on the 24th day of March, 1881. The
circumstances were peculiarly startling. By an accident he fell through
an open hatchway in his own packing house and never recovered
consciousness, although he continued to breathe for several hours. We
can never forget our emotions over this event. It was truly an
inscrutable Providence. Mr. Sinclair was at that time a young man, full
of vigor and energy. He was a pillar of strength upon whom many leaned.
He had done so much to bring the college up to this point of its new
beginning that both he and we were looking forward with desire and
delight to what might be accomplished through his co-operation. But it
was willed otherwise. We cannot interpret the event, but may we not
even now at this comparatively far removed time from its occurrence use
it in memory of him for the greater glory of God and increase of the
college. "He being dead, yet speaketh."

Dr. Stephen Phelps, then the pastor of the Presbyterian church at
Vinton, had been very prominently connected with the college ever since
its reconstruction as Coe Collegiate Institute in 1875. And now, when
it became Coe College, under the care of the synod, he was invited to
become its president. He was by nature and grace a pastor greatly
beloved by his people, and very useful in the community at Vinton. It
was a great request to make of him to ask him to lay down his pastoral
office and undertake the new and untried work of a college president.
And this was made especially significant because he was asked to
preside not over an institution already well endowed, richly equipped
with buildings, and possessed of the prestige of a generation, but over
an institution still in the process of formation, without any endowment
or equipment or faculty or history. He paused to consider his duty, and
decided to come to the college and with the help of God to undertake
the task.

He was a man of many gifts; an eloquent preacher and lovable pastor who
attracted young people to him, and a man of consecration and singleness
of aim. His pure spirit and untiring energy were rewarded with much
success in spite of the many difficulties which resulted from the
limitations of the new situation. He remained in the presidency of the
college six years, when he resigned his office to go back to his loved
work in the pastorate, to which he felt called of God. He became the
pastor of the Presbyterian church at Council Bluffs, and has
subsequently served other churches, until at the present time he is in
charge of the church at Bellevue, Nebraska, where he lives enjoying the
respect and affection of all who know him. He will ever be cherished as
the first president of Coe College.

Another figure that rises very prominently and pleasantly before us, as
we go back to this period of our history, is that of the first
treasurer of Coe College, Mr. John C. Broeksmit. Mr. Broeksmit became
the treasurer of Coe Collegiate Institute in 1878, and passed on into
the new administration in 1881, and continued in the exercise of his
duties as treasurer until he was made treasurer emeritus in 1903, when
Mr. John M. Dinwiddie, our present very efficient treasurer, assumed
the duties of the office which Mr. Broeksmit laid down. In the
formative period of our college history it was very important that the
charge of our slender funds should be placed in hands which were
trustworthy, not only because of honesty, but also because of business
ability and experience. Mr. Broeksmit possessed ideal qualities for a
treasurer. As auditor of the B., C. R. & N. R. R. he was accustomed to
the handling and careful accounting of the funds of that corporation,
and he brought his knowledge, judgment, and integrity to bear upon the
financial affairs of the college. We always felt secure in placing
these affairs in his hands, and we were not disappointed. Besides his
services as treasurer, he also rendered valuable services as a
trustee, always faithful in attendance, and giving his full and entire
interest to the matters in hand; wise in counsel, kind and genial in
manner, and friendly in attitude, he was a peculiarly attractive
co-laborer. He should be written down as one who loved his fellow men.
His decease in March, 1907, at the age of 82, was universally lamented.

We note the fact that Williston Hall was completed as a boarding hall
and dormitory for young ladies in 1881-1882, and the college building,
which had been occupied more or less since September, 1868, for school
room purposes, was enlarged in 1884 by an addition which simply
duplicated the original building.

In 1882 the Rev. E. H. Avery, D. D., who had succeeded Dr. Phelps in
the pastoral charge at Vinton when Dr. Phelps came to Cedar Rapids to
be president of Coe College, came into the board of trustees, and was
elected president of the board. He remained in this office until 1899,
when he removed to California where he subsequently died. Dr. Avery's
long administration of seventeen years was marked by his qualities of
cool, calm judgment, enlightened understanding, and zealous attention
to educational interests. He was punctual in attendance at the many
meetings of the board, and of the executive committee, coming down from
Vinton many times at much sacrifice of personal comfort and the laying
aside of his pastoral work, and during that long and eventful period,
marked by so many changes from 1882-1899, it was fortunate that we had
so wise and safe a president of our board as Eugene H. Avery.

On the 13th of May, 1887, the Rev. James Marshall, D. D., was elected
president of the College to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation
of Dr. Phelps. Dr. Marshall was an alumnus of Yale University and had
spent several years in New York City in city missionary work. He
entered upon the duties of his office in September, 1887. He brought
with him to these duties a mind matured and well rounded, a culture
produced by wide reading and considerable foreign travel and residence,
and an intelligent appreciation of college work. He had a strong sense
of the value of discipline in college life. He was much assisted by his
cultured wife, whose attractive personality won for her a valued place
in the hearts of the students. Mrs. Marshall died in Cedar Rapids after
a brief illness in November, 1892, leaving her husband sadly alone, for
there were no children in the household. Dr. Marshall labored on
bravely in his work until September, 1896, when, just at the opening of
the college year, he was stricken down with pneumonia, and his death
occurred after a few days amidst circumstances of peculiar solitude.
His funeral services were conducted at the First Presbyterian church of
this city, September 13, 1896, and the address on that occasion was
given by Dr. J. Milton Greene, then of Ft. Dodge, Iowa, now of Havana,
Cuba, and a life long friend of the deceased. Dr. Marshall is the only
one of the presidents of our college who has departed this life, and he
died literally in the harness. In summing up his life and work we avail
ourselves of the words which it was our privilege to report to the
board at their meeting October 13, 1896:

     "He was a man of power, the power that is born of the
     possession of a high ideal and consecrated purpose and
     unusual faculty to organize, and an unflagging zeal to
     execute and perform. He never spared himself. He forgot
     himself, but he never forgot the college. His works do
     follow him. These works which remain with us are the strong
     and united faculty which he organized, and which he inspired
     with his own high ideals, the noble standard of scholarship
     to which he elevated the curriculum, the beautiful campus,
     which is a wonder of improvement when we contrast it with
     what it was when his hands first touched it, and the example
     of industry and energy which his life has furnished. It
     seems pathetic that he should have passed away without
     seeing the fulfillment of the hopes he so dearly cherished,
     and the plans be so wisely formulated. But it is a common
     thing in this world that one should sow and another reap.
     One conceives the building of the house, but leaves it to
     another to build it. Yet no one ever thinks that the former
     lives in vain."

The college pursued its work in the year 1896-7 without a president,
and it is a happiness to note the fact that owing to the harmonious
cooperation of a devoted faculty and a sympathetic body of students,
the year passed with much smoothness and prosperity.

On the 5th of August, 1897, the Rev. Samuel B. McCormick, D. D., was
called to the presidency of the college from the pastoral charge of the
Presbyterian church of Omaha, Neb. He entered upon the duties of his
office with the opening of the college year 1897. He soon made it
manifest that a man of great vigor was directing its affairs. He went
at his work with a spirit almost fierce, and he kept at it with a
persistency that compelled things to come his way. His energy was
contagious, and his colleagues in the faculty and on the board of
trustees felt it from the day he came among us until the day he left.
The pace he kept was not always pleasurable, but it was always
fruitful. It was during the seven years of his administration that
great growth of the college was experienced in the size of the faculty,
the number of the student body and increase of college buildings. The
financial campaign that was undertaken to secure the $25,000 promised
by Mr. Ralph Vorhees, of New Jersey, on condition of our raising
$125,000 additional, was successfully conducted when Dr. McCormick was
president. It was he who brought to Coe College the Rev. H. H. Maynard
as field secretary, and the two men worked together with congenial
vehemence and brought things to pass. Among the things which were
brought to pass was the present college gymnasium a very useful and
attractive asset.

In the summer of 1904 Doctor McCormick was invited back to his old home
in western Pennsylvania to become the chancellor of the Western
University of Pennsylvania, located at Pittsburg, and which is now
called the University of Pittsburg. This invitation was attractive to
him chiefly because it seemed evidently to offer him unusual
opportunity of enlarged usefulness in the educational field to which he
had devoted his life. Yet it plainly caused him a struggle to sever his
connection with Coe College, and with Cedar Rapids as a city. For in
the seven years of his life here, he had become strongly attached to
his friends and to the community which were strongly attached to him.
He also left this portion of our country, the Mississippi Valley which
was to his mind so full of hope and promise, with great reluctance. Yet
it was clear to him that he ought to go, and we parted from him with
much regret September 15, 1904.

Marshall Hall and the Athletic Field House were erected in the summer
of 1900, the latter the gift of Mr. C. B. Soutter. The College
Gymnasium was completed in 1904.

During the year following the departure of Doctor McCormick the duties
of the presidency were discharged by Dr. Stephen W. Stookey. Dr.
Stookey was an alumnus of Coe of the class of 1884, the first class to
be graduated after Coe became a college. He was always from the
beginning greatly attached to the college, and after teaching a while
in the schools of Manchester, Iowa, he returned to his alma mater in
1892 to become professor of the natural sciences. From that time onward
he filled a place of very distinguished usefulness in the institution,
commanding the high respect of his fellow workers in the faculty, the
student body, and the board of trustees, until 1908 when he left Coe to
assume the office of the presidency of Bellevue College, Nebraska, a
position which he still occupies very much to the benefit of that
school of learning.

Store and Post Office]

At this point of our story we note the fact that at the October meeting
of the board of trustees in 1899, Mr. C. B. Soutter was made the
president of the board. Mr. Soutter had been a resident of Cedar Rapids
since 1881 when he came from New York city to fill the very responsible
place in the business house of T. M. Sinclair & Company made vacant
by the death of Mr. Sinclair. The duties of the management of the large
packing house were very onerous and responsible, yet Mr. Soutter was
able, besides fulfilling them, to give much of his valuable time to his
duties as a trustee of the college, to which he was called in 1883. He
had already, therefore, for many years, shown marked interest in
college work and adaptation for it by taste and culture when in 1899 he
was felt to be the logical successor to Dr. Avery in the presidency. He
entered at once with zeal and intelligence upon his new and enlarged
duties. He was unintermitting in his attention to them until he
resigned his office in October, 1907, and, greatly to the regret of his
brethren, withdrew from the board of trustees.

On the 23rd of December, 1904, Dr. William Wilberforce Smith was chosen
president of the college to succeed Doctor McCormick. Doctor Smith was
not a clergyman as his predecessors had been and as hitherto has been
usual with American colleges in their selection of a president. He had
studied at Princeton Theological Seminary, and had been graduated
therefrom, but he had never been ordained to the ministry. He had
followed the vocation of a teacher, and was called to the presidency of
Coe from the Berkely School in New York city, a school of high grade
for boys. He entered upon his duties as president of Coe College at the
opening of the college year 1905, and remained with the college for
three years. He is now occupying the very honorable position of head of
the School of Commerce and Finance in the James Millikin University,
Decatur, Illinois.

His administration was marked by three notable events, all of which
indicate stages of great progress in the history of the college: First,
the successful launching of the plans to put the college on the list of
the accepted colleges of the Carnegie foundation for the advancement of
teaching. This took place near the close of the year 1908. Second, the
attainment of the Science Hall, given by Mr. Carnegie at the cost to
him of $63,500 upon the condition that the college raise $45,000 for
its maintenance. Third, the successful completion of a financial
campaign whereby a conditional grant of $50,000 was obtained from the
General Board of Education [John D. Rockefeller Foundation] on the
condition that the college pay all its debts and raise in various funds
the sum of $200,000 additional for endowment and buildings. This
campaign increased the assets of the college by $293,000.

It was during this campaign that the services of the Rev. Dr. H. H.
Maynard, field secretary of the college, were so peculiarly strenuous
and so uniquely valuable. Dr. Maynard merits most honorable mention for
his bold conceptions and his heroic execution of them, wherein the word
"fail" was expunged from his dictionary. Dr. Maynard left Coe College
in the summer of 1908 and has become the vice president and field
secretary of the University of Omaha, Nebraska.

In the year 1908-9 which followed the resignation of Dr. Smith, the
college was governed by a commission of four members of the faculty,
who distributed among themselves the duties of administration. The
result was a smooth and prosperous year, although at the end of it all
parties concerned were looking very wishfully towards a filling of the
vacant office of the presidency. At length, on the 7th of September,
1909, Rev. Dr. John Abner Marquis, pastor of the Presbyterian church at
Beaver, Pa., was chosen to be the head of the college. After due
deliberation he decided to accept the call, and on the 12th of October,
1909, he was presented to the students and friends of the college as
the president-elect. He returned to Beaver to sever his relations with
the church there, with the Presbytery and synod, and he came in
December and entered upon his duties. On the 13th of June, 1910, in
connection with the exercises of commencement week, Doctor Marquis was
formally inaugurated president of Coe College. This was the first time
in which formal exercises of this character were observed in connection
with setting a president over the institution, and the occasion was
greeted accordingly with peculiar pleasure, and large use was made of
it to perfect a relationship which it is believed augurs great things
to the advantage of the college. Doctor Marquis has been so short a
time in his office that it would be too soon to speak of what he has
done, but it is not too soon to say that in the brief period in which
he has been president of the college, he has already awakened the
fondest hopes and most steadfast convictions that under his
administration the institution over which he presides is destined to
move forward to a future which will far surpass any measure of size and
value that it ever attained in the past.

On the same week in last June in the midst of the commencement season
which witnessed the inauguration of Doctor Marquis, ground was broken
on the college campus by Mr. Robert S. Sinclair for a chapel in memory
of his father, Mr. Thomas M. Sinclair. This memorial chapel was
prepared for almost thirty years ago very soon after Mr. Sinclair's
death, but the execution of the purpose has been long delayed. But now
at last we see our thoughts and wishes about to be realized in the
erection of a building which shall from its beauty and the purposes
which it is destined to fulfill be a worthy monument to keep in
perpetual remembrance a man, who, in his life-time, did so much to make
it possible for us to have a college at all.

       *       *       *       *       *

We have now accomplished the purpose for which we set out. We have, to
the best of our ability, traced the history of Coe College from its
beginnings to the present time. We have followed the Institution from
its fountain head in the heart and home of the Rev. Williston Jones,
when a handful of young men gathered in his parlor for such elementary
instruction as could be given by the zealous pastor and his wife, down
to the present day, when more than three-hundred students, young men
and maidens, gather in the halls of buildings erected and equipped for
college purposes, and one of these buildings at least prepared and
provided along the most progressive modern lines, the equal of any in
the land. Today the faculty of thirty-two persons conducts the teaching
of a curriculum which embraces every department of learning that is
recognized as belonging to a liberal education. And these teachers have
been prepared for their work by special training and selection.

The endowment also has grown from the paltry sum of $1,500, furnished
in 1853 by Daniel Coe, to the sum of $450,000, and the total amount of
money invested in the plant known as Coe College must exceed $750,000,
which is surely no mean aggregate.

In the course of our history, we have seen a feeble rivulet sink at
least twice in the sands only to reappear with new volume and freshness
further down the bed of the stream. And we see it now a river of such
dimension that it cannot disappear again. We have seen the work of the
heroic men who have nobly spent upon the college in the days when it
sorely needed their help. Such men were not wanting in the days of
emergency but were sent from God. They could not have known as we now
can plainly see what they were doing. They wrought in faith what it is
now given us to possess in sight. They sowed in weakness what we now
reap in power. Surely the lesson is plain and impressive; surely the
teaching of this historical sketch is to the purport that we with our
larger resources should enrich the institution which they sustained and
promoted in their poverty.

They could not see how much worth their while it was to give and labor
for Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute, for Parsons Seminary, for Coe
Collegiate Institute, for the institution was then but a tender, feeble
shoot, whose future development was an uncertainty. We now can plainly
see that it is well worth our while to give and labor for Coe College,
for it is now one of the most potent and promising of all the colleges
in this Mississippi valley. And every intelligent mind who has any
powers of observation and has any experience of college work, knows
full well that as colleges grow and prosper they need more financial
help. It would be the extreme of selfishness and folly to take the
view that Coe College is now strong enough and rich enough to advance
on its present assets to meet its future.

Its needs are greater than ever. But it presents itself not as a beggar
or a suppliant, but as a splendid opportunity for investment. It
presents itself as the finest possible place to locate something to be
spent in buildings, equipment, and endowment whereby in the course of
the years, and we may even say the centuries to come, this money can go
on yielding the richest conceivable dividends in the preparation for
life and leadership of those of our choicest young men and women who
shall come hither from near and far to enjoy the privileges of a
college education. And thus as we close, our history becomes really an
appeal.




CHAPTER XXV

_The Old Blair Building_


The Kimball building in Cedar Rapids stands on the site of an old
landmark--the Blair building. This building, with the land and railroad
companies it housed from time to time, was the center of much history
in the development of Iowa, Nebraska, and the Dakotas. It is difficult
for us to realize now what an immense influence these companies in the
early days had in the settling up of the central west. A debt of
gratitude is due the men who risked their fortunes in this developing
work that many of us now are too apt to forget. Had it not been for the
railroads these early patriots projected into the unsettled portions of
these states the development of the west would have been greatly
retarded. Immigration would have been slow, for people are never eager
to settle in farming communities where there is lack of transportation
facilities to get the produce of the farms to market.

It is felt that a brief account of the influences that went out from
this center is entirely appropriate here. In fact it is needed as a
part of this history of Linn county. Greatly to our regret the
gentleman responsible for the historical data given below wishes his
name withheld, but through modesty only. What is here printed was
furnished by one who knows whereof he speaks, for as Virgil once wrote,
"of it he was a great part."


THE BLAIR BUILDING

John I. Blair, of Blairstown, New Jersey, being then the president of
several railroad companies having their general offices and official
headquarters at Cedar Rapids, erected a building to furnish adequate
room for the business of these companies and for the First National
Bank of Cedar Rapids, in which he was heavily interested. This building
was known as the "Blair Building." In its time it was much the most
pretentious structure in the city. It was located at the corner of
Eagle and Adams streets--now Third street and Second avenue--was two
stories in heighth with a high mansard roof, and set above and back
from the street. The plans for this building were made by W. W.
Boyington, then the most prominent architect in Chicago. It was what
might be termed of the "court house" style, having more the appearance
of a public building than one erected for commercial purposes.

On May 23, 1868, Mrs. Mary A. Ely purchased of A. C. Churchill, for Mr.
Blair, lots 6, 7, and 8 in block 15, including the brick dwelling house
thereon, for the sum of $10,000. Mrs. Ely afterwards conveyed this land
to Mr. Blair, who deeded it to himself and Oakes Ames as trustees for
the several companies who contributed to the cost of the land and the
buildings.

The work of construction began in the autumn of 1868. The building was
completed and occupied in the spring or early summer of 1869. The total
cost of the land, the new building, and the overhauling of the dwelling
house was $54,418, which was paid by the Cedar Rapids and Missouri
River Railroad Company, The Iowa Rail Road Land Company, the Iowa Falls
and Sioux City Railroad Company, the Sioux City and Pacific Railroad
Company, and the First National Bank of Cedar Rapids.

In 1870 the dwelling house and the land lying southwesterly of the wall
of the Blair building was sold to John F. Ely for $11,000. In 1884 the
First National Bank conveyed its interest to the Iowa Falls and Sioux
City Railroad Company, and thereafter, until the liquidation of the
bank in 1886, occupied the banking room as a tenant. When the bank had
gone out of business, the railroads had been sold and the offices moved
away, and the real estate holdings of the companies very largely
reduced, the owners having no use for the space for their own purposes,
and the building being so constructed as not to be useful for
commercial purposes, it was decided to sell the property. It was
advertised for sale. A customer not being found at private sale, it was
sold at public auction on May 2, 1888, to David P. Kimball, of Boston,
Massachusetts, for $25,000.

Mr. Kimball, together with his brother L. C. Kimball, of Boston, J. Van
Deventer, then of Clinton but later of Knoxville, Tennessee, J. E.
Ainsworth, then of Council Bluffs but later of Williamstown, Vermont,
and P. E. Hall and Henry V. Ferguson of Cedar Rapids, organized the
Kimball Building Company, to whom the property was conveyed.

During the year 1888 the Kimball Building Company rebuilt the Blair
Building, extending its exterior walls out to the street line and added
a new portion so as to cover the entire lot, making the building when
so completed 76 feet on Second avenue and 140 feet on Third street,
four stories high, and thereafter known as the "Kimball Building."

In addition to being the president of all of these railroad companies,
Mr. Blair after 1862 gave personal attention to their construction and
was in absolute control of their affairs in the west. These railroads
came to be called the "Blair Roads," and were so generally spoken of in
the public prints. From this people generally came to think that he was
nearly the sole owner of all, or at least personally owned a
controlling interest in the whole group. This, however, was not the
fact. Mr. Blair's individual ownership averaged about one-sixth, about
another sixth being owned by his associates in the Lackawana Iron &
Coal Company of Pennsylvania, among which were Joseph H. Scranton, of
Scranton, Pa.; Moses Taylor, of New York, and William E. Dodge, D.
Willis James, and James Stokes, who then comprised the firm of Phelps,
Dodge & Company.

The controlling interest was always owned by a group of New England
capitalists and their associates, who were at the same time the
controlling stockholders in the Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska Railroad
Company--the line already constructed from Clinton to Cedar Rapids.
Among these latter were Oakes and Oliver Ames, of North Easton, Mass.;
John Bertram, of Salem, Mass.; Charles A. Lambard, of Maine and later
of New York; William T. Glidden, David P. Kimball, Joseph and Frederic
Nickerson, of Boston, and Horace Williams, of Clinton, Iowa.


THE CEDAR RAPIDS AND MISSOURI RIVER RAILROAD

In May, 1856, congress passed what was then called "The Iowa Land
Bill," making grants of land to the state of Iowa to aid in the
construction of four lines of railway across the state, one of which
was to be from Lyons City, thence "northwesterly to a point of
intersection with the main line of the Iowa Central Railroad near
Maquoketa, thence on said main line running as near as practicable to
the 42nd parallel across the state of Iowa to the Missouri River." The
general assembly of the state by an act approved July 14, 1856, granted
the land inuring to the state for the construction of this line to the
Iowa Central Air Line Railroad Company upon certain conditions
contained in said act. That company began the construction of the road
in the year 1856, considerable grading was done at different points
along the line as far west us Anamosa, but the panic of 1857 coming on
the work was stopped and never again resumed by the Iowa Central Air
Line Company.

It being quite probable that at the next legislative session the state
would resume this land grant and forfeit the rights of the Iowa Central
Company, and pass the grant over to some other company who would
undertake the construction of the road; for the purpose of obtaining
this grant, the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad Company was
organized on June 14, 1859, by the prominent eastern stockholders in
the Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railroad, together with John Weare and
John P. Ely, of Cedar Rapids, and G. M. Woodbury, of Marshalltown,
Iowa.

In March, 1860, the state resumed the land grant from the Iowa Central
Company and made it over to the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River
Railroad. Work was begun on the line west from Cedar Rapids in 1860.
The bridge over the Cedar river was built in the winter of 1860-61, and
forty miles of track completed to Otter Creek Station (now Chelsea)
during the year 1861, and to Marshalltown in December, 1862. Milo
Smith, of Clinton, Iowa, was the chief engineer and had charge of the
construction of the road until it reached Marshalltown.

In 1861 John I. Blair became largely interested in this enterprise, and
thereafter took control of the construction beyond Marshalltown. After
1862 W. W. Walker was chief engineer until the road was finished. Track
was laid to State Center in 1863, and on July 4, 1864, to Nevada, and
to Boone in December, 1864, but the road was not surfaced up, finished
and put in operation from Nevada to Boone until the succeeding year.

In July, 1864, congress made an additional grant of land to the Cedar
Rapids and Missouri River Railroad, and authorized it to change its
line of road so as to connect with the Union Pacific Railroad at
Council Bluffs. Work beyond Boone began in December, 1865, the track
was laid into Council Bluffs in January, 1867, but regular service
between Woodbine and Council Bluffs was not instituted until April of
that year.

In July, 1862, the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad was leased
in perpetuity to the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad Company, which
company then owned the line from Chicago west to the Mississippi River
opposite Clinton, Iowa, and operated the Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska
Railroad under lease. The lease covered not only the portion of the
Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad then built, but the entire
line to the Missouri river when the same should be completed.

On June 2, 1864, the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad Company was
consolidated with the Chicago and North-Western Railway, and from that
time the operation of the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad
under the lease was by the Chicago and North-Western Railway Company.

L. B. Crocker, of Oswego, N. Y., was the first president of the Cedar
Rapids and Missouri River Railroad, and until 1866. Mr. Crocker during
this period was active in the financial affairs of the company, and
especially in obtaining the land grant from the state and the
supplemental grant direct from the United States. While not a man of
large means, he was possessed of great energy and foresight.

John I. Blair was president from 1866 to 1871, when he was succeeded by
Horace Williams, who remained the president until the company went out
of existence in 1884.

In 1884 the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad was sold to the
Chicago and North-Western Railway. It was in fact a consolidation, but
for convenience in handling the transaction it was made a sale, the
Cedar Rapids Company deeding its railroad and all rights and franchises
pertaining thereto to the Chicago and North-Western Railway Company,
receiving its pay in the stock of the latter company, which stock was
distributed pro rata to the stockholders of the Cedar Rapids and
Missouri River Company, after which the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River
Railroad Company closed up its affairs and went out of business.


THE SIOUX CITY AND PACIFIC RAILROAD COMPANY

An act of congress passed in 1862 authorized and required the Union
Pacific Railroad Company to construct a railroad and telegraph line
from Sioux City to a connection with the Iowa branch of the Union
Pacific Railroad, whenever there should be a line of railroad completed
through Minnesota or Iowa to Sioux City, Iowa. On July 2, 1864, the
original Union Pacific act was amended, and among other things it was
provided that the Union Pacific Railroad was released from the
construction of said branch, and such company as should be organized
under the laws of Iowa, Minnesota, Dakota or Nebraska, and be by the
president of the United States designated and approved for that
purpose, was authorized to construct said branch and receive therefor
lands and subsidy bonds to the same extent that the Union Pacific
Railroad would have done under the act of 1862. It was further provided
that if a railroad should not be completed to Sioux City across Iowa or
Minnesota within eighteen months after the passage of said act, then
the company which should have been so designated might commence,
continue and complete the construction of said Sioux City branch.

The Sioux City and Pacific Railroad Company was organized in August,
1864, to construct this branch line and was by the president of the
United States designated and approved for that purpose. The corporators
and first board of directors were Platt Smith, L. B. Crocker, M. K.
Jesup, James F. Wilson, A. W. Hubbard, Charles A. Lambard, Frederick
Schuchardt, William B. Allison, and John I. Blair. Soon afterwards the
Sioux City and Pacific Company passed under the control of Mr. Blair
and his associates in the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad. The
necessary money to build and equip the Sioux City and Pacific was
principally furnished by them. The general offices of the company were
first at Dubuque, but on the passing of the control to the Cedar Rapids
people headquarters were moved to Cedar Rapids.

Construction was begun in the spring of 1867. The Cedar Rapids and
Missouri River Company built six and a half miles of railroad from
Missouri Valley Junction to California Junction, where it connected
with the line of the Sioux City and Pacific. These six and a half miles
were turned over to the latter company. Track laying began at
California Junction in September, 1867. Thirty-six miles were completed
by the first day of December, 1867, and the line to Sioux City in
February, 1868. Early in 1869 the entire line was completed and in
operation between Missouri Valley Junction and Sioux City and to
Fremont, Nebraska, where connection was made with the Union Pacific
Railroad. The cars were ferried across the Missouri river during the
summer months, and crossed on a temporary bridge during the winter
months up to the fall of 1883, when the bridge across the river was
completed and opened up for business. L. Burnett was the engineer in
charge of construction of this railroad and superintendent in its
operation until January 1, 1878.

This company received from the United States a grant of land comprising
the alternate sections within twenty miles on either side of the line
of the railroad. But as nearly all of the government land within these
limits had already been disposed of, and where the grant of this
company lapped over the grant to the Union Pacific Railroad, each
company received half, so this congressional grant only amounted to
about 42,500 acres. There was acquired through a consolidation with the
Nebraska Air Line Railroad a state land grant of 46,000 acres. The
company received from the United States a loan of six per cent bonds to
the extent of $16,000 per mile of road constructed between Sioux City
and Fremont, and issued its own first mortgage bonds to an equal
amount.

This company up to August, 1884, operated its own road and also leased
and operated the Fremont, Elkhorn & Missouri Valley road, as the same
was from time to time extended. The earnings of the railroad were never
sufficient to pay the interest on the first mortgage bonds. The avails
of the two land grants and the proceeds of the sales of the town lots
along the line up to 1875 (when the remaining land assets were sold to
the Missouri Valley Land Company) were used to make up the deficiency.
After these assets were exhausted the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River,
and Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railroad companies, through loans and
other methods of assistance, made up the deficit until the sale of all
of these roads in 1884.

In 1880 the Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska, and the Cedar Rapids and
Missouri River companies by purchase from the individual stockholders
acquired over ninety per cent of the capital stock of the Sioux City
Company. This stock was in the treasury of these railroads at the time
of their purchase by the Chicago and North-Western Railway Company in
1884. Through and under that purchase the Chicago and North-Western
Railway Company became the controlling owner of the Sioux City and
Pacific and moved its general and operating offices away from Cedar
Rapids.

John I. Blair was the first president of the Sioux City and Pacific
Railroad Company and was succeeded by Horace Williams in 1871. Mr.
Williams was president until the fall of 1877, when he resigned and was
succeeded by Oliver Ames. Mr. Ames remained president until the control
of the railroad passed into the Chicago and North-Western Railway
Company.


THE IOWA FALLS AND SIOUX CITY RAILROAD COMPANY

In the Iowa Land Bill of 1856 a grant was made to aid the construction
of a line of railroad from Dubuque to Sioux City on the same terms as
fixed for the other three trunk lines across the state, viz: a grant of
every odd numbered section within six miles on either side of the
railroad, and where such odd numbered sections had already been
disposed of by the United States, the railroads were authorized to
select an equal number of acres from the odd numbered sections within
fifteen miles of the line of the railroad. This grant was given over by
the state of Iowa to the Dubuque and Pacific Railroad Company, which
company began the work of construction but afterwards failed and was
reorganized as the Dubuque and Sioux City Railroad Company. This last
named company continued from time to time to extend the line
westwardly, so that in 1867 it was completed and in operation to Iowa
Falls.

Considerable right-of-way had been acquired between Iowa Falls and Fort
Dodge and the grading already commenced when a sale and transfer of the
right-of-way, the uncompleted work and the portion of the land grant
belonging to the line west of Iowa Falls, was made to John I. Blair and
his associates. The Iowa Falls and Sioux City Railroad Company was
organized on October 1, 1867, and on January 7, 1868, by a contract of
that date, took over from the Dubuque and Sioux City Company all the
right-of-way west of Iowa Falls and the work already done, also the
proportion of the land grant inuring to the line west of Iowa Falls and
all of the rights and franchises of the Dubuque & Sioux City Company
pertaining to that portion of the line.

Prior to this date, viz: on September 13, 1867, the Dubuque and Sioux
City Railroad Company leased to the Illinois Central Railroad Company
the portion of its road already constructed to Iowa Falls and also the
line to be thereafter built from Iowa Falls to Sioux City. This lease
was for twenty years or in perpetuity at the option of the Illinois
Central Railroad Company. The legislature of the state of Iowa on April
7, 1868, passed an act ratifying the said sale by the Dubuque and Sioux
City Company and vesting the land grant in the Iowa Falls Company.

[Illustration: CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH, CENTRAL CITY]

[Illustration: CHRISTIAN CHURCH, CENTRAL CITY]

The work begun by the Dubuque and Sioux City Company was vigorously
prosecuted so that the road was completed and in operation to Fort
Dodge early in 1869. In the fall of 1870 it was finished through to
Sioux City and the entire line turned over to the Illinois Central
Railroad Company for operation under the lease. J. E. Ainsworth was
superintendent of construction. In the original articles of
incorporation the principal place of business of this company was fixed
at Dubuque, Iowa, but in October, 1869, the articles were amended and
the main office of the company moved to Cedar Rapids. John I. Blair was
the first president. He was succeeded in 1871 by Horace Williams, who
remained at the head of the affairs of the company until the control of
the same passed into the hands of the Illinois Central Railroad.

In March, 1887, the Iowa Falls and Sioux City Railroad Company sold to
the Iowa Rail Road Land Company the remaining acres of its land grant
and all assets accruing from land transactions. At that time all of the
individual stockholders of the railroad company sold their shares to
the Illinois Central Railroad Company, who moved the offices of the
corporation from Cedar Rapids to Dubuque, and afterwards consolidated
the company with the Dubuque and Sioux City Railroad Company.


THE FREMONT, ELKHORN AND MISSOURI VALLEY RAILROAD COMPANY

This company, while a Nebraska corporation, soon after its organization
and up to 1884 kept its general offices and accounting department in
the Blair building in Cedar Rapids. It was organized at Fremont,
Nebraska, in January, 1869, to construct a line of railroad up the
Elkhorn Valley, in Nebraska, and obtained a land grant from the state
of Nebraska amounting to about 100,000 acres, also some county bonds
from Dodge and Cuming counties, Nebraska. In 1869 John I. Blair and his
associates in the Sioux City and Pacific, and the Cedar Rapids and
Missouri River enterprises obtained control of the company, and
undertook the construction of the railroad. Ten miles of track north
from Fremont were laid late in the season of 1869. In 1870 the road was
finished to West Point, and leased to the Sioux City and Pacific
Company, which company from that time on continued to operate (under
said lease) the several extensions of the Elkhorn road up to August,
1884. In 1871 the road was extended to Wisner, a distance of fifty-one
miles from Fremont, where the terminus remained until 1879, in which
year the main line was built to Oakdale, and six miles of track laid on
the Creighton branch north from Norfolk. In 1880 the main line was
extended from Oakdale to Neligh, and the Creighton branch finished to
Plainview. In 1881 the main line was extended to Long Pine, and the
Creighton branch finished to Creighton. In 1882 the main line was
extended to Thatcher, and in 1883 to Valentine. In August, 1884--at the
time of the purchase of the Iowa roads by the Chicago &
Northwestern--this last named company acquired all the stock in the
Fremont, Elkhorn & Missouri Valley Railroad, and thereafter the work of
extension was pushed vigorously.

In the two succeeding years a line was built into the Black Hills
country and the main line of the road extended to the eastern boundary
of the state of Wyoming. Between 1884 and 1888 several lines of
railroad in the south Platte country of Nebraska were constructed by
the Fremont, Elkhorn & Missouri Valley Company. L. Burnett, was
engineer in charge of location and construction until the road was
completed to Wisner. From 1879 to 1889--during which period the main
line from Wisner to the west line of the state, the Black Hills branch
as far as Whitewood, and the South Platte lines were built--P. E. Hall
was superintendent of construction and J. E. Ainsworth chief engineer.
John I. Blair was the president from 1869 to 1872, Prince S. Crowell,
of East Dennis, Massachusetts, from 1872 to 1876, and James Blair, of
Scranton, Pennsylvania, from 1876 to 1883, when he was succeeded by
Horace Williams, who remained the president of the company until the
control was taken by the Chicago & North-Western Railway Company in
1884.


THE MAPLE RIVER RAILROAD

The major portion of the land grant to the Cedar Rapids and Missouri
River Railroad--transferred to The Iowa Rail Road Land Company--was
situated north of the main line of the Cedar Rapids & Missouri River
Railroad. In 1876 a large portion of several counties was vacant and
still the property of the land company, so the stockholders interested
in the Cedar Rapids & Missouri River Railroad and The Iowa Rail Road
Land Company decided to build branch lines north from the main line to
the end that purchasers might be found for the land and thus settle up
the country, and furnish business for the main line. The Maple River
Railroad Company was organized in that year to build these lines. The
money for the building of the same was furnished by the stockholders in
the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River, and Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska
companies, they taking the stock and bonds of the Maple River Railroad
Company issued for construction. The road was leased to the Chicago &
North-Western Railway Company in advance of construction. Work was
begun in the fall of 1876, and in 1877 the line was completed from
Maple River Junction to Mapleton, a distance of about sixty miles.

In 1879 a branch was built from Wall Lake Junction to Sac City. This
Sac City branch was extended to Holstein in 1882, and in 1883 to
Kingsley. The building of the above lines was under control of P. E.
Hall, vice president. J. E. Ainsworth was the chief engineer. In 1884
when the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River, Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska,
and Sioux City and Pacific roads were purchased by the Chicago &
North-Western, the Maple River Railroad was included in the sale, and
from that time on became a part of the Chicago & North-Western Railway,
which company has since extended the branch line from Kingsley to
Sargeants Bluffs, thus making another through line from the east into
Sioux City, and also extended the main line from Mapleton to Onawa.


THE MISSOURI VALLEY AND BLAIR RAILWAY & BRIDGE COMPANY

In 1882 congress granted to the Sioux City & Pacific Railroad Company
the right to build a bridge across the Missouri river to connect the
Iowa and Nebraska portions of its railway at the point where the line
crosses the river between Missouri Valley, Iowa, and Blair, Nebraska.
The Sioux City & Pacific Company not being financially able to
undertake the work, assigned its rights under said act to the Missouri
Valley and Blair Railway & Bridge Company, which company was organized
in 1882 for the purpose of building the bridge and its approaches. The
capital stock of the bridge company was subscribed for by the several
railroad companies whose roads made up the through line from Fremont to
Chicago, viz: the Sioux City and Pacific, Cedar Rapids and Missouri
River, Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska, and the Chicago & North-Western
companies, each taking stock in proportion to its mileage in the
through line between Fremont and Chicago. The money for the
construction of the bridge was raised principally by the sale of bonds,
which bonds were guaranteed--both principal and interest--by the
several railroad companies who were stockholders in the bridge company.
Work was begun early in the summer of 1882 and the bridge completed and
opened for traffic in November, 1883.

When the bridge was opened for business it had cost about $1,300,000,
of which $400,000 was for the bridge proper across the channel of the
river and the other $900,000 for the approaches and protection work.
Several hundred thousand dollars have since been expended in protecting
the river banks so as to hold the channel of the river under the
bridge. After its completion the bridge was operated by the Sioux City
and Pacific Railroad Company under a contract.

Horace Williams was the president of the bridge company from the date
of organization to the time when the control passed to the Chicago &
North-Western Railway. P. E. Hall was vice president and in general
charge of construction. George S. Morrison was the engineer who made
the plans and directed the building of the bridge. When the Chicago &
North-Western Railway Company took over the Cedar Rapids and Missouri
River and the other roads in 1884, it became the owner of the entire
capital stock of the bridge company and moved the accounting offices
away from Cedar Rapids.

The total grants of lands to these companies by the United States, the
state of Nebraska, and several counties in Iowa, amounted in the
aggregate to about one million, nine hundred and ninety thousand acres.
As the several railroads were projected it was the policy of the
companies to acquire land around the stations and plat and sell town
lots. For convenience in distribution of the proceeds to the
stockholders, and in handling the real estate, land and town lot
companies were organized from time to time to take over and dispose of
not only the land grant lands but of the purchased lands and town lots.


THE IOWA RAIL ROAD LAND COMPANY

This company was organized in 1869 and its capital stock distributed
pro rata among the stockholders of the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River
Railroad. The land grant of that railroad company was conveyed to the
land company on September 15, 1869. In 1887 the Iowa Rail Road Land
Company bought from the Iowa Falls and Sioux City Railroad Company for
cash, all of its remaining unsold lands and the bills receivable, and
other assets resulting from previous sales.

From time to time thereafter, through consolidation and purchase, all
of the remaining real estate and bills receivable of these several land
and town lot companies and of the Moingona Coal Company, which were
under common control, passed to the ownership of The Iowa Rail Road
Land Company.

The Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad was finished in 1867, and
the land grant completely earned then. From that time on the officers
of the railroad company and of its successor, the land company, for
thirty-five years persistently and continuously worked to have this
land grant finally adjusted so that the tracts actually granted might
be definitely known and the companies receive evidence of title
thereto. Their efforts were finally successful in 1902.

John I. Blair was the first president of this company. Horace Williams
was president from 1871 to 1872. In 1872 J. Van Deventer, then of
Clinton, Iowa, and later of Knoxville, Tennessee, was elected president
and remained so until 1889, since which time P. E. Hall has been the
president of this company.

Henry V. Ferguson, now vice president of this company, came into the
employ of these companies in 1868, and has been continuously in their
service since that time. P. E. Hall has been an officer of The Iowa
Rail Road Land Company since 1871.


THE TOWN LOT COMPANIES

The Blair Town Lot and Land Company was organized in June, 1871, and
took over the unsold town lots and purchased lands along the line of
the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad, and also the avails from
previous sales. It was consolidated with The Iowa Rail Road Land
Company in 1888.

The Sioux City and Iowa Falls Town Lot and Land Company, organized in
1871 to dispose of the town lots and purchased lands along the Iowa
Falls and Sioux City railroad between Iowa Falls and Sioux City, was
consolidated with The Iowa Rail Road Land Company in 1888.

The Elkhorn Land and Town Lot Company was organized under the laws of
the state of Nebraska in February, 1871. There was conveyed to this
company the land grant made to the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley
road, also the purchased lands and town lots at the several stations
between Fremont and Wisner. This company was consolidated with The Iowa
Rail Road Land Company in 1899.

The capital stock of these three companies was issued pro rata to the
stockholders of the respective railroad companies along the lines of
which these town lot companies respectively operated.

The Missouri Valley Land Company was organized in May, 1875, and
purchased for cash the remaining unsold portion of the land grant of
the Sioux City and Pacific Railroad Company, as well as the unsold town
lots and purchased lands belonging to that company. This company was
consolidated with The Iowa Rail Road Land Company on May 3, 1901.


THE MOINGONA COAL COMPANY

When the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad was extended west
from Boone there was purchased for account of the stockholders of that
company certain timber and coal lands at and near Moingona--where the
line of railroad crosses the Des Moines river. The Moingona Coal
Company was organized in June, 1866. These coal and timber lands were
conveyed to that company, and its shares of capital stock ultimately
allotted pro rata to those stockholders in the Cedar Rapids and
Missouri River Railroad, who had furnished the money for the
construction of the line west of Boone--known as the third division of
the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River Railroad. The town of Moingona was
platted and put upon the market and coal mines opened at that point,
which mines were operated continuously for about twenty years. In 1899
mining operations had ceased and the personal property of the coal
company having been closed out, the remaining real estate was turned
over to The Iowa Rail Road Land Company.

The aggregate sales up to 1910 made by these railroads, land and town
lot companies and this coal company, including land grant lands,
purchased lands, and town lots, amount to sixteen million, six hundred
and sixteen thousand dollars. The taxes paid by said companies on said
real estate while held by them amount to two million, seven hundred and
forty-seven thousand dollars.

For many years it has been fashionable for magazine writers and a
certain class of politicians to severely criticise and condemn the
public men of that day for their action in making land grants to
railroad companies. The members of congress have been characterized as
imbecile and corrupt, and the recipients of land grants denounced as
thieves and robbers. While it is quite probable that in some cases
sufficient care was not exercised, and that such grants sometimes have
been a little too liberal, looking at the situation as it was in those
days and the subsequent results, there can be no doubt whatever that
the policy was a sound one and the action of congress in most of the
cases exactly right.

A large portion of what is now known as "the middle west" then
consisted of vast unbroken stretches of prairie land, impossible of
settlement because of the want of timber for fuel and building
purposes. This territory could not support a population until
transportation facilities were provided for carrying in the necessary
lumber, fuel, and supplies, and carrying away the agricultural products
as the land should become cultivated. The price of the land at private
entry was then $1.25 per acre. The government gave half of the lands
within the land grant limits to the railroads and immediately advanced
the price on the even sections to $2.50 per acre, not only getting the
same amount of money for the same acreage, but making sales of the
government land much more rapidly.

[Illustration: MILL AND DAM, COGGON]

Soon after the first of these grants was made it became the policy of
the government to give away its public lands to actual settlers. Until
the railroads were built through these vast bodies of vacant lands it
had not been possible for the United States to even give away its
lands, but after the construction of such roads the whole of this vast
territory was in a few years occupied by actual settlers. This
settlement and the growth in population and wealth resulting therefrom
have more than any one thing contributed to the present greatness of
this United States.

The land grant railroads taken as a whole have not been a source of
much profit to the original stock and bond holders. In many cases the
companies have been forced into extensive and costly litigation to
protect their rights; taxing authorities--both county and state--have
regarded these land grant companies as legitimate prey. The fact that
these several lines of road were built in advance of settlement and
civilization in almost every instance, made the first earnings of the
roads insufficient to pay interest on bonds issued for construction,
let alone dividends to stockholders, so that quite often a large
portion of the avails of the sales of these lands had to be used to pay
interest on the bonds.

A majority of the land grant railroads have gone through reorganization
and foreclosure, some of them several times. In the cases where there
has been a profit to the original investors, it has been no greater
than it ought to have been considering the risks run.




CHAPTER XXVI

_Some of the Old Cemeteries_


The father of Osgood Shepherd, who died in the summer of 1839, was
interred at the top of the hill above the tracks on A avenue in Cedar
Rapids where the Cedar Rapids Candy Company has erected a building.
During the excavation several other graves were found, but it is not
known who were buried there.

Another cemetery where a number of old settlers were buried was on
Fifth avenue and Eighth street where W. W. Higley later settled; these
bodies were removed when Oak Hill Cemetery was laid out. At Linwood
burials were made at an early date. One of the first cemeteries was
known as Craig's cemetery on section 7 in Franklin township about three
miles west of Mt. Vernon. Elias Doty was buried here in 1841 and James
Doty in 1847. Members of the Craig family and many others of the first
settlers were also buried here. This cemetery is not now kept up and it
is not even surrounded by a fence.

Campbell's cemetery was set off by Samuel Campbell, who donated an acre
for cemetery purposes. Here Samuel Craig was buried in 1840, members of
the Oxley family, the Hunter family, and of the John Paul family, also
of the Smith, Berry, Snyder, Blaine, and Darr families, names familiar
to all who have a knowledge of early Linn county history.

The Rogers cemetery, laid out by old Dan Rogers, is on the west side of
the river near Ivanhoe. Here, also, are buried many of the first
settlers who lived on the west side of the river.

A little to the north of Cedar Rapids near the Illinois Central track
the relic hunter can find some ruins of what is known as "McCloud's
Run." Only a few crumbling ruins remain of what used to be an old mill
known to all the old settlers in the county. Through this picturesque
valley runs a winding brook known as "Cold Stream," a beautiful rivulet
whose clear transparent water plays sonorous music as it runs swiftly
over the pebbles as if hastening to join its forces with the Cedar. The
surrounding hills have in a good measure been shorn of their beauty by
cutting down the timber, and now only the naked clay hills remain,
offering a poor pasture for cattle. West of this stream on top of the
hill overlooking the city can be found a few broken headstones and some
mounds, but no flowers and no evergreens can be seen, not even a fence
of any kind, for this little space, like all the surrounding hills, is
given up to the pasturing of cattle. There in the vicinity of the city
are more than ninety mounds showing that Linn county was from the
earliest time a fit abode for man. Who these first settlers were we do
not know; they have left us no other relics but these mounds; their
funeral pyres and a few carvings indicate that they were Sun and Star
worshippers, but whether they belonged to our Indian race has never
been ascertained; however, the mound builder serves as a chain in man's
existence.

On the top of this hill is located the family cemetery of the McCloud
family. John McCloud came here in 1838, and for a number of years was
one of the prominent men of this county. From an examination of the
small marble slabs thrown about in confusion, scratched by the hand of
vandals, are to be found the following inscriptions: "Departed this
life June 6, 1846, Hester, consort of John Vardy, age 37 years; in life
beloved; in death lamented." "Angelia, died August 30, 1852." "Grant,
died March 29, 1852." "Alpheus, died December 28, 1861." "Eliza Jane,
died January 11, 1862." "Ester Ann, died January 11, 1861, 15 years."
All were children of John G. and J. McCloud. "John McCloud, died
November 10, 1863, age 61 years 7 months and 29 days."

Mrs. John Vardy died in 1846 and was buried in this cemetery. Many of
these places are neglected, and weeds grow in profusion and the head
stones are marred and weather beaten so that the names, dates and
deaths of many pioneer men and women have been effaced. This is the
history of many neglected burial places in various parts of this
county.

Owners of land on which these small places are located think more of
their value for corn lands than they do as places for a cemetery, and
in many localities these cemeteries have been changed into pastures and
corn fields and not even a headstone can be found to tell where some
dear father or mother was buried in the long ago.

The Egyptians, Jews, Greeks, and Romans all protected the burial places
of their dead, and after a lapse of 2,000 years we can still go back
and find something as to how the dead were cared for, and the very
place in which they were buried venerated by succeeding generations,
while out here in Iowa after a lapse of only half a century many of
these places have been neglected and ignored and now some descendant
returning to the home of his fathers may be unable to find any trace of
where they were buried. Certainly some protection should be offered by
the county or the state so that these sacred places may be preserved
and the memory of the old settlers duly honored for what they
accomplished during the pioneer days in Linn county.

Spring Grove cemetery, near Palo, is one of the oldest cemeteries west
of the river. Many of the early settlers have been interred in this
lot.

A few of them are: Dyer and Hiram Usher, Charles Dickey, John Garrison,
Peter Davis Burt, Thomas Spencer, George Mathew, J. Z. Drake,
Caldwells, the Rawson and Tweed families, F. Klumph, Mrs. Dyer Usher,
and many others.

Dyer Usher as well as the other members of the Usher families was
always friendly with the Indians and in return shared the good will of
the various Indian tribes. In an early day one of the chieftains died
and was buried in the cemetery lot of the whites according to the
Indian customs. This brave was interred with bows and arrows as well as
with the dead carcass of a horse or Indian pony. Here the Indian brave
has slept for many moons, ready at the final day to join the good
Indians on a fleet charger for the happy hunting ground in the by and
by.

In the Wilcox cemetery, near Viola, Edward M. Crow and his two wives,
many old pioneers as well as old soldiers are laid to rest.

Shiloh cemetery, in Rapids township, has been the burial place for many
years of the old settlers in that part of the township.

Scotch Grove cemetery, near Fairfax, has also been used for many years
and here are interred most of the old settlers who died in that part of
the county.

The Marion cemetery, the Lisbon cemetery, the Center Point cemetery,
where is interred a Revolutionary soldier, as well as the Oak Hill
cemetery in Cedar Rapids are all places where a large number of the old
settlers have been buried during the past fifty years.

The town cemeteries seem to be kept up while the country cemeteries are
neglected.




CHAPTER XXVII

_Early Experiences in Stage and Express_


One way to learn of the history of a city is by studying its
developments and the men who were its leaders in progressive
enterprises and in things political. It is another phase of the matter,
none the less important, to study the lives of the men who did the
persistent everyday work three hundred and sixty-five days in the year
and sometimes, it seemed, almost twenty-four hours in a day. Cedar
Rapids was fortunate in having a large number of both classes of these
pioneers.

Among the latter class who worked steadily and everlastingly from the
time Cedar Rapids was a straggling little village to a city of its
present size and who aided materially in its upbuilding is W. Fred
Reiner, in the early fifties a stage driver out of this city, and for
many years after a messenger of the American Express company. It may be
safe to assume that Mr. Reiner handled as much money and bullion in
pioneer days as did any man in Linn county. His experiences were common
to the stage driver and express messenger of the early day. How he
overcame one difficulty after another, escaped highwaymen, pulled
himself out of mud-holes, etc., as he interestingly relates, is what
was the life of the real pioneer of the early fifties and sixties. The
events which are most vivid in Mr. Reiner's mind are those which
occurred after he became an express messenger for the American Express
company.

We are indebted to the _Republican_ for the following interesting
account of the experiences of Mr. Reiner in the stage and express
business:

It is fifty-three years since Mr. Reiner, at the age of eighteen, left
his home in Germany to risk his future in America. Coming west, he
settled for one year at Columbus, Ohio, then pushing still farther
west, he came to Iowa City in 1854. Here for a little while he did
teaming and other work, then began driving stage between Marengo and
Iowa City. Soon he was driving for the Western Stage Company. In 1857,
while in the employ of his company, he drove the first stage from
Calamus, near Dewitt, at that time the terminus of the Chicago and
Northwestern Railroad, to this city. It was while on this route running
to Calamus that Mr. Reiner first became acquainted with Conductor
Holten, now of Des Moines, and well known all over Iowa as the oldest
conductor in the employ of the Chicago and Northwestern.

After working in this capacity for a while Mr. Reiner returned to Cedar
county and took up farming. Soon coming back to Iowa City, he went to
the stage company's office and was immediately given a stage between
that place and Cedar Rapids.

One day while on his route he met at Solon the proprietor of the stage
company coming from Iowa City with a four-horse stage. The new stage
drew up along where Mr. Reiner was, and the proprietor called, "Fred, I
want you and your team." Wondering what was going to happen, Mr. Reiner
immediately unhitched his horses, and the driver of the leadhorses on
the other stage had also unhitched his. Mr. Reiner's team was put on as
the leadhorses, and he was told to get on the stage. While coming on
into this city the proprietor informed him that he was to run the new
stage from this city to Springville, at that time the end of the
Dubuque and Southwestern railroad.

[Illustration: HIGH SCHOOL, CENTRAL CITY]

[Illustration: BRIDGE OVER WAPSIE AT CENTRAL CITY]

As the railroad was pushed nearer and nearer Marion, the stage route
became shorter and shorter, until it was finally between Cedar Rapids
and the county seat. It was while driving between this city and Marion
that he began to carry express, and that in an unusual way. One of the
express messengers who ran into the county seat and whose home was at
that place, had to accompany the express down to this city each night
on the stage. There being no return stage until morning, he was
compelled to spend the night in Cedar Rapids. He would very often ask
Mr. Reiner to take charge of the express at Marion and bring it to this
city. The express messenger was Dr. J. M. Ristine of this city, now one
of the best known physicians in the state.

One day Supt. Thomas Adams, of the American Express company, was at
Marion. He opened a conversation with Mr. Reiner in the course of which
he asked him if he would be willing to take a position as express
messenger on the western end of the Northwestern, at that time nearing
the city of Boone. Mr. Reiner took the matter under advisement, and
later accepted the position.

Going to Boone, Mr. Reiner was given the first express route from that
city through to Omaha. With the railroad stopping at Boone, and nothing
more than a mere trail to follow, with a few stopping places, this
route on to the Nebraska city was everything but pleasant. Nevertheless
Mr. Reiner took hold of the work, and on November 7, 1865, after
forty-eight hours of almost continuous riding, he carried the first
express ever hauled by the American Express company into the city of
Omaha.

Early in the morning of the last day a stop had been made at Council
Bluffs for breakfast, and when Mr. Reiner was ready to continue the
regular stage had gone. The local agent hustled around and found a
carriage which he turned over to Mr. Reiner, so that the first express
which the American Express ever took into Omaha did not go by stage,
but by carriage.

There was nothing delicate or easy in the route assigned to the new
messenger. He left Boone on Tuesday afternoon. The stage, by changing
horses at regular intervals, went steadily on during the afternoon and
night, and all the next day and night. Early Thursday morning it would
pull into Council Bluffs, where a stop for breakfast was made. The trip
was then continued to Omaha, which was reached during the forenoon.
Leaving Omaha that same afternoon at four o'clock, the return trip was
commenced and kept up until Boone was reached at nine o'clock Saturday
morning. As Mr. Reiner had previously driven stage he was nearly always
found upon the seat with the driver. Thus he was exposed the same as
the driver was. Through all kinds of weather, the blizzards of winter
and stifling heat of the summer, these trips were made with greatest
regularity. Gradually, however, the railroad was worked farther and
farther westward, and the stage driver's route shortened accordingly.

During this period of his life Mr. Reiner had many trying and sometimes
exciting experiences. Although he is modest about relating them, those
which he told a reporter illustrate what the messengers of that period
had to contend with.

"I remember one time," said Mr. Reiner, "it was in the spring of the
year and the roads were in terrible condition. From Panora to Boone
there was one slough after another. We were driving along one night. I
was on the box with the driver, when we came to a wide slough. There
were tracks where others had driven through, but of course, we could
not go across in the same place for fear of cutting through. But the
slough looked all right, so we started in a new place. We had got into
the center when suddenly the wheels cut through the sod and the stage
sank into the water-soaked ground clear up to the axles. The four
horses began floundering around in a most dangerous manner. Both the
driver and I jumped from our seats down into the mud and water, and as
soon as possible unhitched the horses.

"There we were, stuck in the middle of the slough with nine passengers
on the inside of the coach, one of them a woman. They, of course, had
been aroused by the disturbance, and now called loudly to know what
they should do. There was but one thing that could be done, and that
was to get out and wade to shore. This they did, one of the gentlemen
carrying the woman on his shoulders. They were told that if they would
follow the road for three miles they could find lodging for the night.
A spring snow was on the ground, and the air was cold, but they started
on their way. The driver, capturing one of the horses, jumped on it and
rode for help.

"I was left there alone. In the stage coach was my express containing
some very valuable property which I did not dare to leave under any
circumstances. There was but one thing for me to do, and that was to
wade back to the stage coach and climb in and stay there until help
should arrive. This I did. I wrapped myself in my buffalo robe which
was the best I could do, but it was far from comfortable.

"In the morning help came and we were pulled out of the mud hole. A
fresh set of horses was hitched to the stage and we were soon at the
next stop. Here we met all the passengers. They had had good beds to
sleep in and warm breakfasts, so were anxious to be off. I hastily
swallowed a cup of coffee, and still in my wet clothes, climbed up on
the box seat, and rode all that day and the next night without a rest.
This was but one of the experiences which were familiar to stage
drivers and express messengers of that time."

Although during his twenty-five years of service for the American
Express company Mr. Reiner never lost a penny which had been placed in
his charge, it was not because he did not have his opportunities to do
so.

"There was one experience," he remarked, "that I remember well, and
which came as near being a hold-up as I ever had. It was the same week
that an additional express messenger had been put on the route between
Boone and Omaha, and our routes had been altered accordingly. The stage
left Boone on a Monday afternoon and was in the neighborhood of
Denison. It was a bright night and the horses were jogging along at a
good gait.

"Suddenly ahead the driver saw two men crouched by the roadside. As we
drew near they both sprang out into the road and began firing at us
rapidly. One of the first shots struck and killed the rear horse on the
left hand side. The other three animals sprang forward with such force
that they fairly jerked the harness off from the animal which had been
shot. They circled to the right and the wheels of the coach ran over
the fallen animal. The animals continued their circling until they
completely reversed the coach, then they turned and ran down the road
along which we had just come. It was always believed that the
highwaymen did not know of this change, and thought the stage carried
express as before. But the fact was I had left Boone on Monday instead
of Tuesday.

"The driver, according to the story he told me afterwards, was cussed
most roundly for not stopping the team, but he insisted that the
shooting the robbers had done so frightened the horses that they had
become unmanageable. Although the highwaymen were far from satisfied
with the explanation they made the best of a bad matter, and began to
search the driver to see what they could find. He gave them his
pocketbook, which, he said, contained forty dollars. That, by the way,
is more money than I ever saw him have at one time, and considerably
more than stage drivers usually carried. The hold-up men took the money
and gave the pocketbook back to him, as it contained some papers he
wished to save and which were of no value to the robbers.

"Soon after this incident, while going over my route one cold night the
driver stopped the team and called to me. I sat in a seat on the inside
with my revolvers lying beside me. Getting out of the door, the driver
told me there was a man crouched down in the road ahead of us. We were
out on the prairie some miles from a station. I went forward, with no
feeling of pleasure, to investigate. The man came forward also and I
recognized him as a fellow who had been lying around one of the
stations for several days. I asked him what he wanted and he replied
that he wished to get in and ride for a ways. Although the night was
cold I could not let him in for fear that he had companions farther up
the road and was only getting inside to get the lay of the land. The
express was unusually valuable that night. The fellow ran along behind
the coach for some time, but the horses gradually outdistanced him, and
that was the last we ever saw of him."

After the completion of the railroad, Mr. Reiner was given a position
as express messenger on one of the trains. "Many times," said the
veteran express messenger, "I have literally had the car floor paved
with gold and silver, over which I walked in doing my work. We had
carried lots of gold and silver bars east from Virginia City, in
Nevada. In order that, the weight should be evenly distributed the bars
were spread like paving bricks all over the car floor. The following
description, written by a reporter from one of the Council Bluffs
papers while Mr. Reiner was yet at Boone, gives a description of the
work of carrying the bullion:

"While viewing the scenes at the transfer yesterday afternoon, we
boarded W. F. Reiner's Northwestern express car and beheld a scene that
caused our hump of inquisitiveness to jump. Mr. Reiner is a messenger
of the American Merchants Union Express company, and will have served
in his present position and on his present route seven years in
November next. He lives in Boone. On the floor of his car were
sixty-seven gold and silver bricks. That is, each brick was composed of
gold and silver in compound. In some of them, silver predominated--in
value. They resemble silver almost entirely in color. They are of
somewhat irregular sizes, though nearly every one of them weighs more
than one hundred pounds. Some of them were much more refined than the
others. The amount of gold and silver in each one is stamped on the
face or top, in different lines, and the total value of the brick is
added in a third line. The value of each metal is marked, even to a
cent. How those values can be so accurately determined in a compound
brick is beyond our knowledge. Fifty-seven of those bricks which we
yesterday saw, were worth $101,950.80. The remaining eleven were worth
$15,077.57. They were mostly from Virginia City and are being taken to
New York. Mr. Reiner informed us also that these bricks are carried
only by the Northwestern and Rock Island roads. On some days he has had
as many as 160 of them in his car. They are taken east nearly every
day."

For ten years Mr. Reiner lived in Boone, then a redivision of the road
brought him back to this city. For the next fifteen years he continued
to run out of this city and do active service. Thirteen years ago the
terrible strain he had undergone in the earlier years of service for
the company began to tell upon him and he broke down in health. Then,
if a private company ever did a good and wise thing, the American
Express company did it. They said they realized the value that Mr.
Reiner had been to them when they were getting established in Iowa and
running their route through to Omaha, and they would not forget his
efficient services now that he was getting old.




CHAPTER XXVIII

_Linn County Libraries_


THE IOWA MASONIC LIBRARY

BY HELEN R. DONNAN

The Iowa Masonic Library, "unique in idea and unapproachable in scope,"
is an institution of which Cedar Rapids is proud, and to which the
Masons of Iowa point as a satisfactory answer to those who would
question the purposes of the fraternity.

As early as 1844 the late T. S. Parvin, grand secretary and librarian
of the Grand Lodge of Iowa, A. F. & A. M., from its organization until
his death in 1901, began the collection of books which today is world
famous. With rare discernment and infinite patience this vast wealth of
treasures has been gathered together and placed at the disposal of all
students.

The library, for years housed at Muscatine, later in the Burtis Opera
House at Davenport, was removed to Iowa City in the year 1867, where it
remained in rooms rented for that purpose until 1883 when it had so far
outgrown its quarters that a new and more permanent home was needed. At
the annual session of 1883, the Grand Lodge set aside $20,000.00 for a
fireproof building, and, the citizens of Cedar Rapids having offered to
donate a lot and $10,000.00, it was decided to build in that city. The
site selected was ideal, fronting on one of the most beautiful avenues,
in the residence district, yet within a few blocks of the business
portion of the city. The front of the building, which is of red pressed
brick trimmed with sandstone, consists of two stories and an attic,
while the rear part is two stories, and under all is a basement, well
lighted and ventilated by a wide area-way. Surrounded by a well kept
lawn and beautiful shade trees, it presents a very attractive
appearance.

So rapidly did the library grow that in 1901 the trustees were
authorized to purchase the adjoining corner lot on which was a fine
brick residence. This has since been used as a general reference
library and reading room, known as the Annex. Both buildings have
recently been improved and re-decorated until today one entering either
one finds "a place of quiet and beauty, where sightseeing is a delight,
and study an absolute pleasure." On the right of the main entrance is
the Grand Master's room, furnished in dark and massive oak, thoroughly
in keeping with the dignity of the fraternity. On the left, a lighter
treatment in decoration and the mahogany furniture make the reception
room a delightful apartment in which the friends gather and are made
welcome. The fireproof doors at the end of the entrance hall open into
the library proper, filled with book cases on every side, and in the
center of the room are large glass cases containing thousands of rare
and interesting curios. The upper floor of this hall is a gallery
guarded by an iron railing and lighted by the skylight above. This,
too, is filled to overflowing with books and display cases. On the
walls of both rooms hang pictures of the long line of Grand Masters who
have ruled the craft in Iowa from 1844 to the present time.

[Illustration: T. S. PARVIN Long Grand Secretary Iowa Masons]

The leading feature of this library is naturally the Masonic
department. Here in cases adorned with meaning symbols are to be found
all the standard works of the fraternity and those which later
scholarship has contributed to the history, philosophy and ceremonial
of Masonry, together with the proceedings of all Grand Lodges,
Chapters, Commanderies, Councils, Shrines, Chapters of the Order of
Eastern Star, and all Masonic organizations of the world. This
department also contains the constitutions, by-laws, monitors, and
rituals of all Masonic bodies, both American and foreign. Masonic
periodicals and magazines from all parts of the globe are on the
shelves in perhaps more complete sets than can be found in any other
library. Many rare and costly works have been added, some few of which
are unique, no other copy being known to exist.

The early history of Freemasonry shows traces of the influence of other
secret societies, and it in turn has influenced almost every other
secret organization. A Masonic library would therefore be incomplete
without the history, literature and ceremonies of these associations.
This semi-Masonic department includes all works bearing upon the secret
societies of the American revolution, the early secret societies of the
middle ages and France, works pertaining to the history of the
Nestorians, Dervishes, Thugs, Druids, Rosicrucians, the Guilds, etc.

As Masonry is closely linked with art, archaeology, mythology, and
religion, a large collection of this class of material finds place in
the general reference library, now housed in the Annex. The French and
German books, comprising some four thousand volumes, the government
publications, and a large number of proceedings have been removed to
the basement, while the attic is crowded with duplicate proceedings,
magazines, and pamphlets without number.

Another interesting feature is the Iowa department containing works by
Iowa authors, as well as all works pertaining to the history of the
state.

In order to make this collection of the greatest possible benefit to
its patrons, it has been classified and a card catalog of the books has
been made in accordance with approved library methods.

For the casual visitor the principal attraction is the museum, which
contains archaeological, mineralogical, and geological specimens from
all parts of the country. Here the relics of ancient American races and
tribes give evidence of prehistoric culture, while the ruder
implements, weapons and pottery of the aborigines make a notable
collection. One large case contains only weapons of warfare; another is
filled with Iowa birds. An unusual collection is the one of shoes from
China, Japan, India, Burma, Siam, and several other foreign lands. The
case of colonial relics is especially interesting to older visitors.
The book lover finds the case devoted to rare and beautifully bound
books the supreme attraction, while the small boy enjoys the stamp
collection, the post card display, the birds, and the "freaks" of
nature exhibited here. Masonic badges, medals, coins, old diplomas,
charters, manuscripts, aprons, and other old lodge paraphernalia are
artistically displayed in the various glass cases. Scattered throughout
both buildings are many pictures, fine art pieces in bronze, bisque,
and marble, antique vases, jars, pitchers, and various pieces of modern
pottery, all donated by friends of the library.

In the autograph letter department are three large double cases each
having one hundred and forty glass covered drawers devoted exclusively
to this material. Here may be found the signatures of noted literary
men, the presidents of the United States, governors of Iowa, and others
prominently identified with the history of the state as well as noted
men of the fraternity.

In 1901, upon the death of T. S. Parvin, the founder of the
institution, his son, Newton R. Parvin, was elected Grand Secretary and
librarian. He is peculiarly fitted for this responsible position,
having served as deputy to his father for twenty-five years, and, like
his father, is giving to the building up of this splendid library the
"enthusiasm and energy of a single-purposed life."

N. R. Parvin being Grand Secretary as well as librarian, the
headquarters of the Grand Lodge are in the library building, and in the
three splendidly equipped vaults are stored many valuable papers and
records. A card index giving the record of every member in the state
has recently been completed and placed in one of the vaults.

The entire expense of maintaining the library is met by an annual tax
of ten cents for each member in the state. All expenditures are under
the supervision of a board of three trustees appointed by the Grand
Master for a term of six years. Those composing the present board are
W. S. Gardner of Clinton, W. L. Eaton of Osage, and Crom Bowen of Des
Moines.


FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF CEDAR RAPIDS

BY JOANNA HAGEY

The people of Cedar Rapids had felt the need of a public library. In
the seventies a subscription library was founded but it was forced to
discontinue from lack of funds and the books were given to the Y. M. C.
A. The City Federation of Ladies' Literary Clubs, and especially the
president, Mrs. C. D. Van Vechten, should be given the credit for
creating a sentiment that resulted in a vote of the people on March 2,
1896, to establish a library.

The council appointed a library board in June. In October the first tax
levy was made, and they began the formation and organization of the new
library which was opened to the public January 15, 1897, in rooms in
the Granby block.

The work prospered and the patronage increased so that additional space
was needed, and in 1900 the library was moved to the Dows Auditorium.

Again larger quarters were demanded and it was deemed best for the city
to own the library building. Mr. Andrew Carnegie generously gave
$75,000, which was used for the erection of the beautiful and
commodious building on the corner of Fifth street and Third avenue. The
new building was dedicated June 23, 1905.

Some idea of the growth of the library can be gained from the following
comparisons: When the library was opened there were 1,325 volumes on
the shelves. December 31, 1909, there were 19,505 volumes; 29,730 books
were circulated the first year, and 94,078 books last year; the
receipts the first year were $4,471.52; last year they amounted to
$11,049.14.

Mrs. C D. Van Vechten, Mrs. Charles A. Clark, Mrs. N. M. Hubbard, Sr.,
Miss Emma J. Fordyce, F. F. Dawley, A. T. Cooper, V. A. Jung, L. W.
Anderson, and Luther A. Brewer constituted the first board of trustees.
The following are the present board: Mrs. Mary Ziek Andre, Mrs. Kate
Terry Loomis, Miss Emma J. Fordyce, Miss Elizabeth Cock, B. L. Wick, L.
W. Anderson, Frank Filip, C. M. Doan, and Sandford Kerr. Others who
have served as trustees are: Miss Meta Aussieker, Mrs. Ida M. Ballheim,
Mrs. Channie J. Redmond, H. H. Troy, Joseph Mekota, John Vosmek, J. M.
Terry, J. T. Hamilton, W. I. Endicott, Jomes A. Molony, Robert Palmer,
John W. Barry, and Theodore Schauwecker.

Miss Virginia Dodge was librarian from 1896-1899, Miss Harriet L.
McCrory from 1899-1903, and Miss Harriet A. Wood from 1903-1910. The
present librarian is Miss E. Joanna Hagey.


COE COLLEGE LIBRARY

Coe College at an early date owned a well selected text-book library.
It was generally conducted by one of the students. Many donations have
been made, mostly by men connected with the Presbyterian ministry. The
large library of Rev. James Knox was one of the early additions made.
Later the Rev. George R. Carroll presented his valuable collection of
books to the college. Many valuable books have been donated from time
to time by members of the faculty, by students, and persons interested
in the growth of the college.

Miss Ida Dodd and Miss Cornelia Shelley served as librarians for some
years. Miss Mary Irene Amidon, by the assistance of several helpers,
has placed the library on a sound basis by a system of cataloguing
which before had been neglected.


COLLEGE AND PUBLIC LIBRARY, MOUNT VERNON

No definite data can be given for the beginning of the library at Mount
Vernon, though in the catalogue of the Iowa Conference Seminary for
1855 the statement is made that "a small but good selection of books
has been procured to which students will have access." There seems to
have been a hesitancy about giving any number of volumes, till in the
catalogue of 1864-5 we read that "the college library has about 600
volumes."

From this early beginning the library very gradually grew in strength
and helpfulness under the direction of various members of the college
faculty. The professors who served as librarians were: S. N. Fellows,
1857-60, A. Collin, 1860-70, H. H. Freer, 1870-73, S. N. Williams,
1873-91, W. C. Webster, 1891-93.

In 1891 Miss May L. Fairbanks was appointed assistant librarian, and in
1893 she was elected librarian, which position she still holds.

A gift of $50,000 was obtained from Andrew Carnegie for a library
building for the town and college. In June, 1904, the corner stone of
the new building was laid, and in August, 1905, the college library,
consisting of 25,548 volumes, was moved into the new building.

December 1, 1905, the library board of trustees was formally organized
with Dr. James E. Harlan as president. Prof. W. H. Norton, Col. H. H.
Rood, E. B. Willix, W. E. Platner, Prof. H. M. Kelly, Dr. A. Crawford,
A. A. Bauman, J. B. Leigh.

There has been no change in the library board. The annual income is
$5,000.

The library now consists of 33,900 volumes and many hundred pamphlets
that have not been numbered. The administration of the library
resembles that of a college more than a public library, and no list of
borrowers is kept.


MARION FREE PUBLIC LIBRARY

Marion free public library dates from 1903. Miss Adaliza Daniels first
began her work as early as 1902, to agitate for a Carnegie library. She
and Mrs. C. N. Owen then began to solicit funds for a building site and
collected $3,775 for that purpose. The first board consisted of the
following: Messrs. Alderman, Alexander, Bowman, Treat, Mrs. Dobson,
Mrs. Busby, Mrs. Owen, Miss Tyler, and Miss Daniels. The present board
consists of J. W. Bowman, president, Dr. J. Morehead, vice-president,
Mrs. C. N. Owen, secretary, Mr. Wood, Miss Marshall, Mrs. B. C. Busby,
Mrs. Millen, and Mrs. Parkhurst.

The income of the library has varied from $1,100 to $1,350. There are
800 card holders and more than 3,550 volumes in the library. The
librarians have been Miss Mary Parkhurst and Miss Mabel Alexander.


THE BOHEMIAN READING SOCIETY

The Bohemian Reading Society was organized November 22, 1868, at Cedar
Rapids, and some of the charter members who are still living are:
Anthony Soukup, Frank Soukup, John Pichner, and John Safranek.

Many of the pioneer settlers contributed from time to time largely of
their means for the purchase of Bohemian books and tried to inculcate
in their children a desire for the reading of books printed in their
own tongue. Many foreign newspapers and magazines were also taken in
order to keep up with the times and to create in the minds of the young
a love of the land of their fathers.

The average number of books loaned has been about 3,000 volumes a year.
The library being open to the members at stated times, much reading is
done in the library building, where a librarian is in charge. The
number of bound books for circulation has been from 2,000 to 2,500
volumes. The expense of running the library outside of room rent, heat,
etc., has been from $200 to $300. Many donations of books and magazines
are constantly being made.

A few of the librarians have been the following named persons: Mrs.
Kabasa, Neibert and Stolba, Frank Kurka. The present librarian has
served continuously for the past sixteen years.

CHAPTER XXIX

_Wages and Prices in the County from 1846 to 1856_


During the decade from 1846 to 1856 land was very cheap in Linn county,
and everything else was in proportion. Wages were low, and what the
farmer raised on his premises he could find no market for, and,
consequently, outside of wheat it was pretty much worthless. The panic
of 1857 was a severe one in the county, and many of the bankers and
business people met with severe reverses from which some never
recovered. No one had any foreboding of the financial storm and all
were caught short to such an extent that they lost nearly everything,
even their homes which had been mortgaged. Many a business man with
good credit, possessed of considerable means, became swamped in the
crash. It mattered not what a man had in property, if it was not in
gold it had no price, and there was no market for anything except on a
cash basis.

From N. B. Brown's account book we glean the following as to prices for
eatables in Cedar Rapids in 1846: Beef, 2-1/2c per pound, flour, 2c per
pound (1-1/2c in 1847), beans, 75c per bushel, veal, 3c per pound,
coffee, 14c per pound, sugar, 16-1/2c per pound, tea, $1.25 per pound,
wheat 37-1/2c per bushel, corn meal, 25c per bushel, buckwheat flour,
1-1/4c per pound. This interesting book is in the possession of Emery
Brown, one of the sons.

During the decade mentioned a horse sold at from fifty to sixty
dollars, and a yoke of oxen could be had for the price of one good
horse. As many of the pioneer farmers had not the means to purchase a
team of horses, they did the next best thing and invested in a yoke of
oxen and thus managed to get along and weather the storm. A good wagon
with spring seat cost from one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five
dollars, and a log chain from two dollars and a half to five dollars.
Ordinary stirring plows sold at from ten to fifteen dollars. Mowers and
reapers were not common in those days, the scythe and the cradle being
the tools with which the young boy earned some of his first spending
money. It was surprising how much hay and grain a good farm hand could
cut in a season in this way.

The people dealt in log houses in those days like we do in second hand
furniture today. These houses were bought and sold at from fifty to
seventy-five dollars each and moved at leisure in the winter time from
one part of the township to another; at times a log house was moved
from ten to fifteen miles and everyone chipped in and helped to move. A
jug of whiskey, some hot coffee, and a good dinner were all they
expected in the way of remuneration for their labor. The young folks at
times insisted on a free for all dance and a free fiddler for the
assistance they had rendered in moving and fixing up the house. If the
young married couple who were to occupy the house did not dance or
believe in dancing, a party or two were given, ending up with a
midnight supper.

While the prices of government land was one dollar and twenty-five
cents an acre, the speculator land generally sold at from five to ten
dollars and as high as twelve dollars and fifty cents an acre. Wages
were very low, from fifty to seventy-five cents a day being the average
price paid a good farm hand. In town a person generally received from
seventy-five cents to a dollar a day and then boarded himself.

Oats sold at fifteen cents a bushel, corn at ten cents, wheat at from
forty-five to sixty cents. Hogs sold at one dollar and fifty cents a
hundred. Potatoes were considered high at ten cents a bushel, while
quail sold at thirty cents a dozen. Butter brought from five to six
cents a pound, and eggs six to eight cents a dozen.

While prices for farm products were quite low the prices paid for the
necessaries of life were high on account of lack of transportation
facilities. Coffee sold at ten cents a pound, sugar at from eleven to
twelve cents, tea retailed at eighty-five cents. Calico sold at forty
cents a yard--and a poor quality at that. Salt in the early days sold
at ten dollars a barrel, the price coming down in Cedar Rapids to five
dollars when W. B. Mack brought his first cargo of salt by steamer from
Ohio to Cedar Rapids.

Nearly all worked on shares, land was rented on shares, grist mills
operated on shares, as well as saw mills. Masons and carpenters had to
take their wages out frequently in form of property, and, while they
were hard up and needed the money, this property in time made many of
them wealthy men by their retaining what had been turned over to them
in the form of wages. Old Thomas McGregor relates how he worked for a
contractor by the name of Robinson and was offered lots where the mills
of the Quaker Oats Company now stand at ten dollars a lot to apply on
his wages, and when the writer inquired why he did not take these lots
he replied: "My wages were seventy-five cents a day, on which I had to
keep a wife and children, and they were more to me than corner lots."
Old James Cleghorn worked for the Greene Bros. in the saw mill and was
offered corner lots, and finally obtained in trade a forty acre tract
of land in Scotch Grove for his summer's work. Old Elias Skinner, the
well known Methodist preacher, in the early fifties traded a team,
harness and wagon for a forty acre tract on what is now the location of
the town of Norway, and at the time thought that the man who got the
team had the best of the bargain, as there was no market for land and
no income from it, while with a team of horses a man could make
something and always could trade it for something else if he wanted to.
Money was a scarce article in those days, while labor was cheap and the
days were long. It was generally work from sun up to sun down and
sometimes until way after dark, and no one was heard to complain,
because if a person did complain there were always plenty of others
willing to take the place of the man who wanted to quit.

There were not many varieties of food in the good old days, but the
people were healthy, they worked hard and everything tasted good. The
ordinary dishes were Indian corn, corn bread, hominy, corn dodgers,
bacon, venison, and prairie chickens. The cooking was done by an open
fireplace, stoves in those days being few. Rye coffee was used
frequently instead of the ordinary coffee and tasted good after a long
day's hard labor in the timber. Many a thrifty housewife worked for
weeks to dry corn in the fall of the year, as well as to dry apples;
hominy was also made at home. All these delicacies--so-called--tasted
good during the winter months and no one was known to be afflicted with
ptomaine poisoning.

Before the days of grist mills coffee mills were used for the grinding
of corn and wheat. In some instances a few of the early settlers used
the Indian stones, turned by hand; later horse mills were erected,
which the early settlers thought were great inventions. These mills
consisted merely of an enclosure of logs with a large wheel in the
middle around which a leather belt was placed, which was also attached
to a smaller wheel which turned the mill stones and ground the corn.
The pioneers would come several miles to such a mill and sometimes had
to wait a day or more in order to get their grist ground. They would
help run the mill, would sleep in the wagon at night and live on
parched corn on the trip; if a cup of coffee could be obtained at the
stopping place the settler would be more than gratified.

While the settlers raised almost all their provisions, they also made
most of what they had to wear. In a very cheap sort of a way they
tanned their own leather and made their own shoes; in short, relied on
their own ingenuity for nearly all the comforts of life.

The women folks were as handy as the men, if not more so, for they were
all spinsters, dressmakers and tailors; they made the blue hunting
shirts with fringes, adorned the buckskin belt which was worn around
the waist, and also cut out the tight fitting cotton blouses worn by
the boys, and even made moccasins and a coarse kind of brogan shoes.
They were furriers as well, for they made some excellent fitting wolf
skin caps for the men and some neat looking gingham bonnets, well
starched, for themselves. While the shoes were at times heavy and ill
fitting, they were only worn on Sundays and during the winter, for as
soon as spring came nearly everyone went barefoot, about the house at
least, for the sake of economy as well as for comfort.

During these pioneer years in the forties and fifties our ancestors did
not have an easy time of it by any means. They endured the hardships of
pioneer life and were subject to fevers, as well as homesickness, and
frequently during the winter months they were exposed to the severity
of the early Iowa winters when the log houses were both small and
uncomfortable, but they were men and women of iron nerve, full of push
and energy and perseverance. They had taken up a tedious battle for
existence out on the barren prairies of Iowa, far away from home and
kindred, and, at times, surrounded by wild frontiersmen, freebooters
and ruffians who were making a last stand in these parts of Iowa until
the opening up of the vast barren tracts west of the Missouri river. It
was not until after the Civil war that the people of Linn county
became, so to speak, comfortably well fixed and had some of the
comforts which they had so long looked for during the early years.




CHAPTER XXX

_Some of the First Things in Cedar Rapids and Linn County_


The first log cabin was erected on the site of what became Cedar
Rapids, by Osgood Shepherd or Wilbert Stone in 1838. The first frame
house was erected by John Vardy in 1842, and the first brick building
was erected by Porter W. Earle at the corner of First avenue and Second
street in 1844.

P. J. Upton, of the Star Wagon Company, received a carload of freight
on the first freight train that ever came to Cedar Rapids; this was in
1859. W. B. Mack received the first cargo of salt on the steamboat
"Cedar Rapids" in 1855, bringing down the price of salt from $10.00 to
$5.00 a barrel.

The first steamboat company, incorporated for $20,000.00, was organized
in 1855, some of the incorporators being Alex. Ely, Dr. S. D.
Carpenter, the Greenes, and other business men of Cedar Rapids.

The first grist mill was built by N. B. Brown in 1843. Isaac Cook was
the first lawyer locating in Cedar Rapids; John Shearer was the first
justice of the peace, and James Lewis was the first constable. The
first general store was opened by George and Joseph Greene in 1842.
Judge George Greene taught one of the first schools near Ivanhoe in
1839 and 1840. Alexander Ely, George Greene, and N. B. Brown, with
others, erected the first school house in 1847 in Cedar Rapids, later
selling it to the school district.

Joseph Greene was the first postmaster in Cedar Rapids and carried the
mail in his plug hat and distributed the same as he happened to meet
the people to whom the letters were addressed.

Dr. S. H. Tryon was the first physician in Linn county. Dr. E. L.
Mansfield was one of the first physicians locating in Cedar Rapids, in
1847. H. W. Gray was the first sheriff of Linn county, being appointed
by Governor Lucas in 1838. The first county fair was held in October,
1855. The first hotel was built in 1847, called the Union House, James
Dyer being landlord; this building was destroyed by fire in 1865.

In 1855 W. D. Watrous, W. W. Smith, and J. J. Snouffer built the
steamer "Blackhawk" for the purpose of navigating the Cedar river. It
ran between Cedar Rapids and Waterloo for two years. It was later
purchased by the government and used for a supply boat on the lower
Mississippi. In the '40s and '50s Mississippi steamboats made regular
trips to Cedar Rapids. The first railroad reached Cedar Rapids in 1859;
it is now known as the Chicago & Northwestern.

The first fire company was organized in Cedar Rapids in 1869. In 1871
the Cedar Rapids Gas Light Company was organized. The first mayor of
Cedar Rapids was Martin L. Barber.

The first steam mill in the county was built by J. P. Glass in 1845.
The first hand-raking reaper brought into Linn county was by William
Ure, of Fairfax township, who hauled it from Chicago by oxen in the
summer of 1847.

The first newspaper in Cedar Rapids was the _Progressive Era_,
published in 1851 by D. O. Finch; the first newspaper in Marion was the
_Prairie Star_, published by A. Hoyt in 1852; the first daily newspaper
published in Linn county was called the _Morning Observer_, the first
number being issued on September 1, 1870, and edited by Thomas G.
Newman and Z. Enos.

[Illustration: WHITTIER]

N. B. Brown erected the first flour mill in 1844; the first woolen mill
was erected in 1848. The first judge of probate in the county was
Israel Mitchell, appointed in 1838. He was also one of the justices.

The first bridge erected across the Cedar river in Cedar Rapids was in
1856 at what is now Seventh avenue. The oldest settler now living in
the county is Robert Ellis, who arrived in 1838.

The first marriage in Linn county was that of Preston Scott and Miss
Betsey Martin, which occurred in July, 1839.

The first white male born in Linn county was George Cone, who first saw
light at Marion, April 12, 1839.

The first death in the county was that of Mr. Williams, who died
January 15, 1839. He was buried in the Campbell cemetery near Bertram.
The inscription on his tombstone is yet visible.

The first mill was erected by John S. Oxley in 1842-43 on Big creek. It
was later purchased by Jacob Mann.

The first citizen to become naturalized was Peter Garren who, during
the October term of court, 1840, as a native of Scotland, renounced all
allegiance to the queen of Great Britain.

James E. Bromwell, who came to Linn county in 1839, will always be
remembered by the residents of Marion. He helped lay out the county
seat. He made the first coffin for the first interment in its cemetery,
assisted in the erection of the first residence in the town, as well as
in the erection of the first store buildings, besides taking time
enough to procure the second marriage license issued in the county for
his marriage to Catherine Gray, on August 26, 1841.

Elizabeth Bennett, a native of Syracuse, New York, who had been reared
in Canada and married to Edward Crow, November 14, 1839, is supposed to
have been the first school teacher in the county. She died in Buffalo
township February 5, 1844.

The first white child born within the confines of Linn county was Maria
Osborn, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Osborn, and was born in
September, 1838. This statement has often been disputed and cannot be
proved with certainty.


THE FIRST GRIST MILL

There has been more or less controversy as to the name of the man who
erected the first grist mill in Linn county. Marshall Oxley insists
that the first mill of this kind was built by John S. Oxley in 1842-43.
It was located in the northwest corner of Linn township on Big creek.
The material used was grown in the immediate vicinity. The dimension
lumber was hewn out of the forest and the roofing was made of
clapboard, then the primitive material used by the pioneers in covering
their buildings. The machinery was purchased in Davenport and
transported by wagon across the prairies. Before the erection of this
mill the early settlers were compelled to take their grists to what was
known as the Catfish mill near Dubuque. Frequently it required several
days to go to the mill and to return home with the flour. Sometimes the
good housewives ran short of flour while the meal was being ground. In
such cases they would grind a little corn in the coffee mills, mix it
with salt and water, cook it, and thank Providence that they lived in a
land flowing with hoe cake, milk and honey.

After the mill had been in successful operation some time two well
dressed gentlemen called at the home of the owner and asked to be given
entertainment for the night. Their request was cheerfully complied
with. Next morning they strolled down to the mill and looked it over.
After they had been hospitably entertained and were about to depart
they represented that one was a patentee and the other a lawyer and
that the owner was using an infringement on their patent. They told him
that if he did not pay them forty dollars they would prosecute him to
the full extent of the law. He paid them the sum asked but remarked
afterwards that he guessed he should have given them a charge of shot.

The mill was operated in successful manner by the miller, Jacob Mann,
until August 15, 1848, when he purchased the property for $500. He
continued to operate it until it was swept away by the flood of 1851,
Mann at this time losing his life in the flood.


A FEW OF THE EARLY ENTRIES TO LAND

A number of people resided in the county and were, so to speak,
"squatters" before the land was opened for settlement and entry could
be made. A few of the following names and locations will give the
reader an idea of some of the old settlers who came here, some of whom
resided on their respective claims before entry could be made.

Peter Kepler entered land in section 1-82-5 June 15, 1842; A. M. McCoy,
James Huntington, Edward Isham, Horatio Sanford entered land in section
2-82-5 from May 17, 1844, to November 3, 1845.

Mary Ann Doty entered part of section 4-82-5 November 29, 1844; Abner
Doty entered land March 11, 1845, in section 3-82-5; William Abbe
entered land in section 5-82-5 in 1844; Henry Kepler entered land in
the same section two years previously. Jesse H. Holman entered a forty
acre tract in section 6 in the same township and range October 12,
1842. During the year 1845 Horatio Sanford, William Abbe and William
Johnson entered considerable land in the same locality; also Allison I.
Willits and Fred Kinley as early as 1842. James, Joe and Robert Boyd
entered considerable land from February, 1843 to 1844 in section 8,
while entries were made in section 10 from 1842 to 1844 by John I.
Gibson, Oliver Day, Oakley Parker, and Robert Stinson.

During the same period the following entries were made in section 11,
to-wit: by Simeon Archer, Oliver Day, John I. Gibson, Nathan Peddycord,
and James Kelsey.

In section 13 the following entries were made from February, 1843, to
1845, viz: by Saul Elliott, Gabe Archer, James Bartley, and G. B.
Bowman.

In section 14 entries were made from 1843 to 1844 as follows: by James
Kelsey, Leonard Platner, John Donahoo, Joe Smith, Ackley Parker, and
Reuben Ash.

In section 15 entries were made from February 22, 1843, to September
18, 1844, by Dan Hahn and James Muckalls; and in section 17 by John
Stewart and John McLaughlin.

In section 18 during the same period entries were made by Nate P.
Wilcox, Meron C. Barnes, and A. J. McKean; George Greene entered a
tract in section 29 February 21, 1843. Nearly all of the above

CHAPTER XXXI

_Society in the Early Days_


The early settlers in Linn county were intelligent and cultured. They
did not come to the county because communities in the east were glad to
be rid of them. It was for far different reasons our pioneer men and
women made their homes here. They looked upon this as a goodly land,
one filled with opportunity, and they entered in and occupied it.

Mrs. R. C. Rock, now in her 83d year, has vivid recollections of
beginnings in Linn county. She came overland from Dubuque in 1850, and
ever since has called Cedar Rapids her home. She says in her first
years here the people took the best magazines of the day, passing them
around so that all might read them. In 1852 there was organized a
literary circle of ladies and gentlemen. This circle met once a week at
the homes of the members. Original papers were read at these meetings,
the subjects being assigned in advance. Occasionally distinguished
lecturers from abroad were obtained. On one occasion Oliver Wendell
Holmes was here, giving an entertaining talk to a large audience on the
"Great Pyramids." Judge Williams, of Muscatine, one of the original
members of the supreme court of the state, was also a lecturer here.
From time to time Dr. J. F. Ely, Judge Greene, and other local men read
papers or made addresses, "and they were always of a high order," says
Mrs. Rock.

Occasionally there were formal parties, as in these days. There was a
greater amount of entertaining a half century or more ago here than
there is now. There were no special distinctions of class, all the
citizens were welcomed. Some of the most hospitable homes were those of
the southern colony, mentioned in another chapter in this book. Dr. and
Mrs. Ely entertained a great deal in their home located where now
stands the old Post Office building. Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Bever were
always hospitable, and the Greenes did their share. Mrs. Rock says
nothing as to her own entertaining in these days, but her home was
recognized as one of most cordial hospitality, refinement and culture.
Col. W. H. Merritt, Gabriel Carpenter, William Greene, Lawson Daniels
and their wives were also pleasant and hospitable entertainers.

Mrs. George C. Haman, whose husband by the way is the oldest business
man in this city--oldest in point of continuous service--wrote in 1906
quite interestingly for the _Republican_ her recollections of society
in Cedar Rapids in the early days. We take the liberty of reproducing
the same here. It is a vivid picture of social doings a half century
and more ago.

     Society in the early days had one pleasant feature that we
     do not have at the present time. There was only one social
     circle and there was not so much society to the square inch
     as there is now. It was before the days of parties with the
     men left out and before the days of clubs and cliques. A
     large social function meant all the social people in town,
     and was thoroughly enjoyed by all, and nothing but sickness
     or death kept any away. The first social affair I attended
     was in '57. Even then Cedar Rapids enjoyed a social
     reputation equal to any town in the state and it soon took
     the lead with such families for social leaders as those of
     Judge Greene, Dr. J. F. Ely, S. C. Bever, Gabriel Carpenter,
     Colonel Merritt, William Greene, Lawson Daniels and a few
     others, who believed that money-getting should not be the
     only aim in life, and believed in a high standard of social
     and literary enjoyment as well.

     The social, literary and religious foundation laid by these
     far-seeing men and women is what gave Cedar Rapids the
     prestige it enjoys among the sister cities of the state. Of
     course in the forties and fifties most of the entertainments
     were simple, but there were red letter days. The first large
     social affair I attended was a wedding, and the first
     wedding I ever attended. It was the marriage of Miss
     Carpenter, daughter of Gabriel Carpenter, to Mr. George
     Weare, brother of the late John Weare and Mr. Charles Weare.
     The bride was lovely. The groom was a young business man of
     Sioux City, where they have lived ever since. The wedding
     banquet was a feast of all the good things that a good
     housewife could prepare, and Mrs. Carpenter was famous for
     her culinary achievements. Her turkey dinners brought joy to
     many friends. She is now in her eighties, and lives a
     retired life.

     While writing the account of this wedding I received a paper
     giving the account of the wedding of a granddaughter of this
     bride and groom.

     The second social affair that stands out prominently in my
     memory is a large party given by Dr. and Mrs. Ely. The
     social functions given at this hospitable home were always
     delightful. The genial personality of the host and hostess
     pervaded every corner of the home, and when one entered its
     portals one knew that Dr. and Mrs. Ely would give a cordial
     welcome. It was a home where all of the new-comers were
     always entertained, the latch-string always being out. Mrs.
     Ely was a very philanthropic woman, was the leader of all of
     the charitable works for many years. Under her leadership
     many of the philanthropic women of today received their
     early training. Her noble works gave them their incentive.
     There were not so many spacious homes as now, but those who
     had them dispensed hospitality most generously and in a way
     not surpassed in these days.

     The home of S. C. Bever, for many years the largest, stood
     where the Rock Island offices now stand. This home was where
     the bishops and other clergy of the Episcopal church were
     always entertained while in town. This home, with its large
     family of young people that drew like spirits, was the
     source of many gaieties. Mr. and Mrs. Bever's hospitality
     many times won financial success for Cedar Rapids. They
     entertained strangers who came to spy out the land. One
     occasion of this kind was in '55, when Judge Greene, Dr.
     Ely, John Weare, Lowell Daniels, W. W. Walker, S. D.
     Carpenter and S. C. Bever all went to Chicago to attend a
     national republican convention. All being business men, ever
     ready to build up Cedar Rapids, at this convention they made
     it their business to meet men from New York and Boston and
     to talk up the advantages of Iowa and what a railroad could
     do, until Mr. Ames of Boston, Crocker, Bertram and others
     came back with the Cedar Rapids delegation, and were taken
     in conveyance through central Iowa. While the men were
     working the eastern capitalists for a railroad the women all
     got busy and prepared for a reception and dance at the home
     of S. C. Bever. Some baked cakes, others prepared meats,
     others the bread and others the ice cream. The whole town
     was invited, so when the eastern men returned, they were won
     completely over and the project of the first railroad into
     Cedar Rapids was laid then and there.

     Homes were often called upon to open their doors to
     strangers in town, who often were induced by the warm
     hospitality and good fellowship to invest their money and
     join hands and build up Cedar Rapids. When a large function
     was given all the friends assisted. Dishes and table linen
     and services were offered. We could not hire a caterer to
     come and prepare refreshments and serve a company. Our
     friends were the helpers.

     The home of William Greene was also one with open doors. It
     stood on the corner of Third street and B avenue. It was not
     a large house, but a very hospitable one. Later William
     Greene built a beautiful house in the block where A. C.
     Taylor, Dr. Ruml and Dr. Kegley now live. The grounds
     covered the whole block and were laid out with landscape
     effect. It was a beautiful place, and many fine
     entertainments were given there.

     The Higley brothers, Harvey, Wellington, Mort and Henry, in
     the early days, lived in small homes, but that did not deter
     them from keeping up their end of social life. Lucy and
     Jennie Higley were fine cooks and charming hostesses. Mort
     and Wellington were jolly good fellows and every one knew
     they were sure of a pleasant time when invited to their
     homes, no matter whether it was to a church social, or a big
     "standup" party as they were called in those days.

     S. L. Dows' first home was like those of the rest of the
     pioneers, small, but hearts were large and no one extended a
     more cordial welcome to their friends than Mr. and Mrs.
     Dows. After they built their new home on First avenue, many
     brilliant affairs were given by them.

     The home of George C. Haman, on the corner of A avenue and
     Fifth street, is an old land mark. Mr. and Mrs. Haman have
     lived there for over forty years. Their children were born
     and brought up there, and like many pioneer homes, it has
     been the scene of many festivities and good times.

     The home of the late John Weare, with its large family of
     young people, will always be remembered by the old settlers.

     The home of Mr. and Mrs. Belt, now owned by Mrs. George W.
     Bever, was the scene of many enjoyable house parties.
     Friends from eastern cities and prominent people throughout
     Iowa were entertained there. Mrs. Belt loved to entertain
     the clergy.

     The entertainments given by Judge and Mrs. Greene were the
     crowning social events of early days. The home and estate
     were outside of town, but that was no obstacle to their
     entertaining. Judge Greene was ready for every emergency and
     the home was characteristic of the man. He was broadminded,
     warm hearted, foresighted, generous and philanthropic, and
     his home was conducted on these plans. His first house on
     his beautiful estate, Mound Farm, was not large, but he
     always found a way to entertain his friends and visitors to
     Cedar Rapids. For example, he had a house party of friends
     and wished Cedar Rapids people to meet them. He was at the
     time building some buildings to shelter his sheep, of which
     he had a great many. So he put floors in the building
     preparatory to entertaining his guests and friends. He found
     on short notice that if he expected to have the only good
     music in town he must take it next day. He and Mrs. Greene
     talked the matter over and decided to have the party. They
     sent word to the other members of the Greene family and
     intimate friends what they expected to do and they all came
     to their assistance. Early in the morning Mrs. Belt made out
     the list and the family delivered the invitations. Mrs. Belt
     and Mrs. William Greene baked all the cakes. I don't know
     just how many picked strawberries, but Mrs. Greene told me
     that eighty quarts were picked and hulled that day. Mrs.
     Greene superintended the making of the ice cream and the
     decorating of the building. Special train service over the
     Dubuque and Southwestern was arranged to bring the guests
     from a central point to the sheep pens. All was in readiness
     and the host and hostess ready to receive their guests at
     eight o'clock. It was a most enjoyable event, and is still
     recalled with pleasure by the old settlers. It is safe to
     say that with the conveniences of today, such a social
     affair could not be gotten up in one day. Later when Judge
     Greene built his large house on the crowning point of Mound
     Farm, in the center of the beautiful grounds which he had
     been ten or more years preparing, Mr. Paddington, an English
     gardener, had it in charge. Every kind of shrub and tree
     that could be grown in Iowa was planted. The place for
     situation and beauty could not be equaled in Iowa, and the
     grounds were the most beautiful. When Judge Greene had the
     walls up and ready to roof, a tornado tore them down. But
     notwithstanding this discouragement, his house was built
     and furnished with the richest furnishings of those days.
     Three thousand dollars worth of oil paintings hung on the
     walls. All the furnishings were bought in New York City.
     When all was complete, he opened it with a most brilliant
     house warming. As Judge Greene always considered Cedar
     Rapids and her citizens in whatever he did, all were bidden,
     as were many of his friends throughout the state, to the
     opening of his new house. The beautiful impression of the
     illuminated grounds and house and the cordial hand-clasp of
     welcome from host and hostess that thrilled each guest with
     good fellowship and heartfelt appreciation were never
     forgotten. Indeed it was an evening of rare pleasure.

     There were a few years when fancy dress parties were all the
     rage. The first one given was in the home of Colonel Merritt
     and was novel and beautiful. Colonel and Mrs. Merritt were
     charming entertainers. Colonel Merritt built the house where
     Dr. J. H. Smith now lives. It was bought by John W.
     Henderson. He and his handsome and cordial wife entertained
     hospitably. After Dr. Smith owned the house, he and his wife
     dispensed hospitality lavishly and state politicians were
     often their guests.

     The Daniels home was another of the hospitable homes, where
     many large parties were given especially for the pleasure of
     the younger set.

     The home of Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Cook was for several years
     the largest and most modern in the city. Mrs. Cook, with her
     charming daughters, gave many elegant parties. The house was
     built by I. N. Isham. He only occupied it for a few years
     and sold it to H. G. Angle, who lived there one year. J. S.
     Cook then bought it and lived there many years. Now it is
     used for the National hotel annex.

     In the home of Mr. and Mrs. A. R. West, children as well as
     their older friends, found a warm welcome. The little folks
     loved to congregate there and entertainment and refreshments
     were always provided for them. "Papa and Mama West," as the
     children called them, were never too busy to answer all the
     questions asked by their young friends, who were always made
     to feel thoroughly at home.

     The home of Mr. and Mrs. R. C. Rock was one of hospitality
     and of culture and refinement, as well. No woman ever did so
     much toward the education of the young people in early days
     as Mrs. Rock. She was also a great worker in the church and
     is the only living charter member of Grace Episcopal church.

     The first church wedding was in the little Second
     Presbyterian church. It was the marriage of Mr. George C.
     Haman and Miss Louise Wolf. It was at five o'clock in the
     morning, and the wedding breakfast was at 4 o'clock. The
     reason for having the wedding at this unseemly hour was that
     the bride and groom were going east and there was only one
     train a day left town, and that was at six in the morning.
     The attendants at the wedding were Mrs. M. P. Mills, nee
     Coulter; Mrs. Portus B. Weare nee Risley; Mrs. Taylor, nee
     Earl, and Miss Carpenter, bridesmaids. The groomsmen were
     Mr. James L. Bever, Mr. Carter Berkley, Mr. Mortimer A.
     Higley and Dr. Lions.

     The first large public affair in Cedar Rapids that gathered
     together all the people of the town, all in the state who
     could get here and some from Chicago and the east, was in
     June, '59. The occasion was the completion of the first
     railroad into Cedar Rapids. It was the Chicago, Iowa and
     Nebraska, now the Chicago & Northwestern. The citizens had
     looked forward to this for many years, and it was a
     financial struggle to get it through, but when it was
     completed there was great rejoicing. A great celebration was
     given. The tables for the banquet were spread where now
     stands the Masonic Library, and the George B. Douglas home.
     The women prepared all the edibles and with the assistance
     of the young men and girls, served the banquet. The men took
     charge of the speeches, parade and music. The depot was then
     in the lower end of town, about Twelfth avenue and Fourth
     street. The speeches were made there. At the finish the
     marshals of the day formed all in line and marched to the
     grove where the banquet was spread, and it is needless to
     say the feast was enjoyed. I fear there were not twelve
     baskets full left. The climax of the occasion was a ball
     given at Daniels's hall, that stood where the Masonic Temple
     now stands. It was a brilliant affair and the dancers tipped
     the light fantastic toe until the rosy dawn was breaking.
     The weary dancers wended their way home on foot, the girls
     in tarlatan gowns and white kid slippers. Public carriages
     were scarce, and the new and only bus had gone to meet the
     early train. Thus ended the largest public social event up
     to that time.

     The years from '61 to '65 were years of great anxiety and
     all the entertainments given were to gather the forces to
     make all we could to get delicacies for our soldiers who
     were fighting in the Civil war. The women, as always, did
     their part. Mrs. Ely, with her loving heart and her capable
     leadership, directed the younger women. Dramatic
     entertainments were given by the young people. I recall some
     of those who took part: The Misses Carrie and Kate Ely, Dr.
     Lions, William Berkley, J. H. Haman, Miss Laura Weare, the
     Misses Coulter, Miss Earl, Miss Risley, Mrs. Dr. May,
     William Baker, Mr. and Mrs. Haman, Hall, Wood, Stibbs, and
     Carroll. The rest of the men had all gone to the war and
     most of these finally went. Sociables and fairs were then
     held to raise money. There were days and nights of sewing
     and packing barrels to be sent to the seat of war. These
     were the days when all personal sacrifice was a pleasure.
     When the war was over and the pall of horror was lifted, the
     first joyful events were given in honor of fathers,
     husbands, brothers and lovers home from the war. Days and
     nights were spent making flags and banners, twining arches
     that were placed over the street, cooking of good things.
     Nothing was too good for the soldier boys. When the tables
     were spread in the grove the returned soldiers, led by
     Colonel T. Z. Cook, Colonel Merritt, Colonel Coulter, and
     General Jack Stibbs marched up the street. Many were scarred
     and lame and with emaciated faces. The bullet-riddled flags
     were carried at half mast for those who fell in the battle
     or died in southern hospitals. Our tears of joy were mingled
     with tears of sorrow. For a year or two afterwards all
     entertainments were given to raise money for soldiers'
     widows and orphans. Parties and fairs of every description
     were given.

     A colonial ball was given in '59, in which Colonel T. Z.
     Cook and Colonel Merritt and General Jack Stibbs came in
     military costume. All three were handsome men with soldierly
     bearing. All who attended this ball were in colonial dress.
     To me it was the most beautiful social function of those
     days. There were a number of beautiful women and handsome
     men who looked well in colonial style of dress.

     This party was given at Carpenter's hall Tuesday evening,
     March 1, 1859, and was for the benefit of the Mount Vernon
     fund. The patronesses were Mesdames Wm. H. Merritt, H. G.
     Angle, S. C. Koontz, Wm. Greene, J. G. Graves, W. B. Mack,
     C. B. Rowley, H. W. Perkins, S. D. Carpenter.

     The committee on arrangements was composed of Wm. H.
     Merritt, H. G. Angle, R. R. Taylor, W. B. Mack, D. M.
     McIntosh, Lawson Daniels, Edward J. Smith, Hon. Geo. Greene,
     S. D. Carpenter, Wm. Greene, John G. Graves, T. Z. Cook, H.
     B. Stibbs, T. S. McIntosh, Wm. Berkley.

     In '69 and '70 there was a fine course of lectures by Bayard
     Taylor, Henry Ward Beecher, Barnum, J. G. Saxe and other
     noted lecturers. The money raised was used to fit up a small
     public library which was in circulation for a number of
     years.

     Judge Greene built a fine opera house and always gave the
     use of it for entertainments for charity and the ladies gave
     a great many affairs. It was not unusual for them to make
     one thousand dollars at one entertainment, for everything
     was donated and people attended entertainments of that sort
     better then than they do at the present day. Years ago towns
     in the vicinity of twenty miles returned social courtesies.
     In the winter of '68 Iowa City and Cedar Rapids got very
     friendly. A party of young people were invited to a ball
     given at the Kirkwood in Iowa City. The weather was cold,
     the snow deep; but bob sleds were rigged up with buffalo
     robes. This party started out early, but owing to the deep
     snow and an upset or two, it was late when they arrived. But
     they had a pleasant time and returned late next day.

     Marion and Cedar Rapids were very cordial to each other.
     When the homes of I. N. Preston, Mr. Twogood, and Preston
     Daniels were opened with social events a number of Cedar
     Rapids people were invited and these families gave beautiful
     parties.




CHAPTER XXXII

_Southern Influence_


In every frontier community we gauge the settlement by the influences
which predominate. Thus we have the Buckeye, the Hoosier, and New
England elements in certain states and communities, making these local
influences more or less marked traits of character, according to the
size of the settlements, and also the temperaments of the settlers. In
an early day there arrived in Linn county a number of people from South
Carolina, who located here and influenced the social side of this
frontier settlement in a marked degree. These families settled here in
1849: The Legare, Bryan, McIntosh, Stoney, and other families. The
Legare family came from John's Island, about ten miles from Charleston,
where they had lived for several centuries, being of an old French
Huguenot family, which had removed to England and from there emigrated
to America. It was here, or rather in Charleston, that Hugh Swinton
Legare was born in 1789, the mother being of Scotch descent and related
to Sir Walter Scott. Hugh Legare first obtained a private education
from a Catholic priest, later graduating from the University of South
Carolina. He embarked in 1818 for France, later taking up studies in
Edinburgh and on the continent. After a stay of two years he returned
to America to take charge of his mother's plantation. Not until 1822
did he begin the practice of law in Charleston; he also edited the
_Southern Review_, and in this journal advocated views opposed to
nullification. His attitude on this question brought him into
prominence, and he was elected attorney general of the state. While in
Washington he met Livingstone, then secretary of state, who offered him
a position as minister to Belgium, which he accepted. After his return
to America he was elected to congress in 1836, but was defeated for
re-election in 1840 on account of his opposition to the sub-treasury
bill. He was rewarded by President Tyler with a place in the cabinet as
attorney general, and for a time acted as secretary of state. He died
in 1843, one of the best known public men of his time.

His sister, Margaret Swinton Legare, who had been her brother's
travelling companion and most intimate friend, in 1849 brought a
fortune to Cedar Rapids. She was accompanied by her nephews, B. S.
Bryan, Hugh L. Bryan, and Michael Bryan. It is said that nearly $80,000
in cash were at one time invested in property in this county by this
family alone. A large part of this amount was invested in lands and in
a woolen mill, which was located near what is now known as the Cooper
mills.

Michael Bryan was married to a Miss Dwight, a distant relative of
General Marion. She was also wealthy in her own name. A bank was
started by the Bryans and the Wards in the early fifties known as Ward,
Bryan & Co.'s Bank. This bank failed in the panic of 1857, Colonel I.
M. Preston becoming receiver.

Donald M. McIntosh, Mrs. Rutledge, and her sisters, Joanna and Harley,
came about the same time and were related to the other families. Many
other less prominent southern people during these years came to Cedar
Rapids which could boast of a true southern society. Mr. McIntosh
erected one of the first brick dwellings in the city and held various
public offices. Michael Bryan was alderman in 1851, while B. S. Bryan
was elected city recorder. The Bryans were not outspoken in politics,
but McIntosh was a democrat, the aunt, Miss Legare, held to the whig
tenets of her illustrious brother, whose speeches and works she
edited. She was also interested in church work, as well as in the
education of women.

Michael Bryan erected a fine residence where the old N. B. Brown
homestead is now located. At this house social affairs of the little
town were conducted in true southern style, and fortunate was the
person who was favored with an invitation to visit in the Bryan home.
Michael Bryan died here, and the widow with her family returned to
South Carolina just preceding the Civil war. B. S. Bryan removed to the
coast and is still living in Seattle.

Miss Legare organized a ladies' seminary, and was an artist of
considerable talent. She was also an accomplished musician. It is said
that she brought the first piano to the county. However, this claim has
been disputed as it is said that the J. P. Glass family brought a
musical instrument here in 1846.

In the '50s Miss Legare became the wife of Lowell Bullen, an uncle of
the Daniels brothers, whose home was in North Brookfield,
Massachusetts. They resided at Marion until Mr. Bullen's death in 1869,
when the widow returned to her old home in South Carolina, surviving
her husband a number of years.

Nearly all the members of the southern society were members of the
Presbyterian church, and took an active part in the religious and
social work of that people. Mrs. Bullen was kind and considerate. Her
dignified presence was enough to give her entrance into any home. She
took an active interest in the poor, and was interested in education in
general. She loved and revered the memory of her statesman brother, and
never forgot what place he held at one time in the affairs of the
nation. During the rebellion she felt that her heart would break as she
thought of friends and relatives fighting on both sides in that
terrible struggle for the preservation of the Union.

A letter received lately from Bryan & Bryan, attorneys of Charleston,
South Carolina, throws some light on this subject:

     "In reply to your letter of the 10th instant, we beg to say
     that H. S. and B. S. (Benjamin Simons) and Michael Bryan, of
     whom you speak, were the sons of Col. John Bryan, a planter
     of this section.

     "He (Col. John Bryan) married a sister of Hugh Legare, the
     writer and statesman, and attorney general of the United
     States. These sons went to Cedar Rapids before 1860.

     "Michael Bryan married Harriet Dwight, a sister of my
     mother, Rebecca Dwight.

     "It happened strangely enough, that my father, George S.
     Bryan, who married Rebecca Dwight, was no relation to
     Michael Bryan, who married Harriet Dwight. (In other words,
     the two Bryans being no relation, married two sisters.)

     "Michael Bryan had several children, the survivors are Emily
     Bryan, married ---- Andrews, now living in Abbeville county,
     South Carolina, with a number of children, her husband being
     a planter; and William Bryan, whose residence is unknown to
     the writer.

     "Michael Bryan's nephew, Edward Bryan, is also living on one
     of our Sea Islands, in the vicinity of Charleston, and is a
     planter. As far as we can ascertain, B. S. Bryan of whom you
     speak, was engaged in banking in Cedar Rapids, and Michael
     Bryan was engaged in real estate, having built up a portion
     of Cedar Rapids. He died in Cedar Rapids before 1860, and
     his family removed back to South Carolina. They were not
     Quakers, but Presbyterians, and attended the Circular
     church, Meeting street, in Charleston, S. C., which was a
     branch of the Presbyterian church."

[Illustration: BAPTIST CHURCH, PRAIRIEBURG]

[Illustration: MILWAUKEE BRIDGE, AT COVINGTON]

In addition to the above mentioned, a large number of cultured and
educated people came from Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia.
Who does not remember the aristocratic and learned A. Sidney Belt, the
robust, courtly old gentleman, Colonel S. W. Durham, the versatile
and polite Judge Israel Mitchell, the genial Oxley brothers, and scores
of other southern men and women?

The members of the Legare, Bryan, McIntosh, Durham, Oxley, Belt,
Mitchell, and other southern families who located in Linn county did
much in changing the manners of this somewhat cosmopolitan community.
These families pursued education. The members had traveled much. They
were descended from some of the most cultured families in this country.
They were social, interesting, and entertained much, and it is needless
to add that the citizens of the county were not slow in receiving the
southern settlers into their homes. The presence of such an influence
in the formative period of the county's history wielded an influence
which has not been entirely effaced after a period of half a century.

Some time later came the Hart brothers, Jacob A. and Caspar J., and for
years the influence of these sturdy men was a power for good in the
city and the county. It will be many years before these splendid
representatives of the southland will be forgotten. The home of Mr. and
Mrs. Jacob A. Hart was a most hospitable one. It was always open to the
new settler from the south, and especially to those who came from
Maryland, their old home. Their commodious brick dwelling that stood so
long at the corner of Second street and Fifth avenue, was a center for
long years of true and genuine hospitality. Its doors were never locked
against a Marylander, and all these felt free to "come early and stay
late." To many a young son of the south Mother Hart was ever the best
of mothers, caring for the sick lads, satisfying their hunger with
fried chicken and Maryland biscuits--oh, who that once was welcomed
there will ever lose the memory of it! Mrs. Hart is yet a resident of
this city, spending a ripe old age in dispensing the same
well-remembered hospitality, going about doing the deeds of kindness.

Mrs. R. C. Rock, herself a pioneer of 1850, has vivid recollections of
beginnings in Cedar Rapids. She knew the Bryans intimately, and also
the Legares. She says they were people of culture. Mr. Stoney, the
husband of Miss Bryan, was educated abroad, and came to Cedar Rapids in
1852 or 1853. These people were led to locate in the city through the
influence of Judge Greene, whom they met in Washington. Mrs. Rock
states that at this day it is impossible to estimate what Judge Greene
meant to the young city. Through his influence people of means,
culture, and learning were induced to come to the city and county. He
traveled a great deal, and something good for Cedar Rapids always
resulted.

J. J. Snouffer was another Marylander who came to Cedar Rapids in 1850,
and for nearly a half century his was a powerful influence in the
community. He was prominent in business and political affairs, and was
ever a loyal citizen.

Dr. Robert Taylor, one of the prominent early physicians, came from
Virginia in 1851. After remaining here a few years he removed to
Philadelphia.




CHAPTER XXXIII

_Some Township History_


BERTRAM TOWNSHIP

In the history of Linn county Bertram township has played a conspicuous
part, and was at various times about to be the township in which were
located some of the most enterprising towns in the county. Ivanhoe,
Westport, also known as Newark, and other places are well known names
among the early settlers. Their locations have been wiped off the map,
so to speak, on account of changed conditions. The following sketch is
taken largely from manuscripts and articles written by the late John J.
Daniels, one of the old citizens of Linn county, one of the early
county recorders, for many years a justice of the peace, and a well
known and enterprising citizen, who was always interested in the old
settlers and in the development of historical research in the county in
early days. Mr. Daniels says:

     "In the early settlement of Linn county the territory now
     forming Bertram township was selected by the early settlers
     for very prominent reasons, it having good mill streams,
     good water, and plenty of good timber near at hand, which
     was so much needed by the early settlers for building and
     fencing. Two of the early pioneers were Thomas W. and Sarah
     Campbell, of Dearborn county, Indiana. They came in the fall
     of 1838 and settled on the northeast quarter of section 27,
     and obtained a patent from the United States March 7, 1844.
     Mr. Campbell was elected the first county treasurer in 1839,
     and in 1840 his first collection of county taxes for
     licenses, ferries, and lands was $985.85. He died February
     22, 1876.

     "Perry and Catherine Campbell Oxley, of Montgomery county,
     Indiana, first located in Linn township, but in the fall of
     1838 came here and took up a claim on the southwest quarter
     of section 22 and built their cabin in the grove near the
     east line. Mr. Oxley was the first constable elected in the
     county in 1839, and was bailiff of the grand jury of the
     county. He was the best shot in the county. He died
     September 30, 1886, universally mourned.

     "Norris and Ann Cone, of Connecticut, came in February,
     1839, and settled on section 21. Mr. Cone later removed to
     Marion. George Cone, their son, claims the honor of being
     the first child born in the township in 1839.

     "James and Elizabeth Leabo and Israel Mitchell, natives of
     Kentucky, in 1838 left the mining regions near Dubuque and
     settled on claims in this township on the north side of the
     river. Mrs. Leabo died September, 1852, and James Leabo
     removed to Oregon, where he died.

     "Mr. Mitchell was a graduate of a Kentucky college and
     celebrated the first 4th of July at Westport in 1838, Judge
     Mitchell being the orator.

     "The first and only election of the county that year was
     held there, thirty-two votes being cast. The first store
     opened in the county was at Westport, by Albert Henry in the
     fall of 1838.

     "James and Mary Scott, of Indiana, came in 1838 or 1839. Mr.
     Scott was an enterprising farmer. He purchased a saw mill on
     Big creek and early built a large flouring mill during the
     fifties. On account of the failure of crops the mill was not
     a success. He died in 1894 in Marion township.

     "Elias Doty, of Ohio, came in 1838 or '39, and in 1840
     commenced the building of a saw mill on Big creek, but was
     accidentally killed at its raising. The mill property later
     passed into the hands of James R. Briney.

     "James Hunter, a native of Ireland, came in 1838 and took a
     claim; he died May 14, 1888, at the age of sixty-nine.

     "Everett Oxley, a native of Kentucky, born in 1812, at the
     age of fifteen removed to Indiana where he married Catherine
     Milner, also a native of Kentucky, coming to Linn county in
     1840. Mr. Oxley died in 1887. Several of the Oxley family
     emigrated to Linn county.

     "Jeremiah Daniels arrived in the spring of 1844 with a stock
     of dry goods, trading for wheat in the fall, shipping same
     by flat-boat to St. Louis. In the fall of 1847-8 he built a
     saw mill on Indian creek and a few years later located a
     flour mill on Big creek. Mr. Daniels died in 1882."

Mr. Daniels further states that some of the early settlers were the
following:

     "Michael and Peter McRoberts, Peter D. Harman, Ben and John
     Dewitt, John, Joseph, and Nancy Gourly, Andrew and Thomas
     Dill, Isaac, Lawrence, Elijah, and Joseph Wain, Louis
     Lafore, Perry and Ann Knapp, Ada J. James, Steve, Charles,
     Daniel, George, Theresa, and Ann Rose, Sylvester Lyons,
     Thomas Rose, James and Thomas Piner, James M. and Susan
     Doty, Abraham Darr, John Arford, Hiram and Mary Leabo-Deem,
     Sam and Rachel Stambaugh, Jonathan and Dorcas Paul, John
     Bromwell, Michael Cox, Louis Kramer, Dr. Grove, Dave
     Stambaugh, James Briney, Leonard Speckelmeyer, James Berry,
     James Anderson, Caleb Dyer, Joseph Caraway, John and Mary
     Scott, and Samuel Durham."

Some of the Bertram justices have been William S. Darr, Frank Allen, W.
B. Plummer, E. Doty, J. C. Anderson.

Bertram township has been the location of a number of squatter towns.
William Stone first staked out a squatter town and called it Westport.
He sold out his right to Albert Henry and then staked out Columbus
where Cedar Rapids is now located. Henry, it is stated, erected two of
the first frame buildings in this town, and in fact in this part of the
county. The only sawed lumber in the entire buildings were the window
frames and the casings. The siding was what was known as shaved lumber.
These buildings were torn down in 1861 by Elias and Daniel Doty. One of
these buildings was used by James Doty for his pottery shop up to the
time of his death. Perry Oxley bought Albert Henry's squatter claim and
he later sold his right, title, and interest in the town as well as in
about 117 acres of land at $2.50 an acre. Now for the first time James
Doty thought he would comply with the law, and on November 12, 1844,
filed a plat in accordance with the law and called the town Newark,
from Newark, New Jersey, his birthplace. Ivanhoe was never platted, but
was only a squatter town founded by Cowles. Colonel Merritt kept the
first store at Ivanhoe for parties in Rock Island. This town had better
prospects of becoming a great city than any other town in the county.
It had a good river frontage, a rich country around it, plenty of
timber and good water, and had the government road besides. For some
unknown cause the place seems to have been ignored when Marion and
Cedar Rapids began to flourish. This is true, that Ivanhoe and Westport
were laid out expecting the river to be the means of communicating with
the outside world. The railroads, mills, dams and other things changed
conditions, and the Indian trading villages came to naught.


FAIRFAX TOWNSHIP

Fairfax township lies in the extreme southwest portion of Linn county.
Prairie creek, at times an unruly stream, drains this part of the
county. In the early day this portion of Linn county had more or less
timber, especially in what is known as Scotch Grove, northeast of the
town of Fairfax. This timber has, for the most part, been cut off.

The first settlers, as far as is known, who came to this part of the
county were Robert and Jane Ure with their family of grown children, in
the spring of 1841. The children were John, Margaret, James, William,
Robert, Walter, and David. The family had emigrated from Scotland in
1838 and gone west, locating in Ohio for a short time, removing to Iowa
territory in search of land. They located in the northwestern part of
the township in the grove which has since been called "Scotch Grove."
The Ures wrote back to Scotland to their friends, and for many years
emigrants came who located in and around Scotch Grove in Linn and
Benton counties. Later came the McDowell family, the Listebargers, the
McKinnons, the Mitchells, Giddings, Knickerbockers, Flahertys,
Ferriters, Henrys, Cahills, Hines, McFarlands, and many others.

A cemetery was established in Scotch Grove where a number of the early
settlers are buried. The cemetery near Fairfax is now the one in use,
and also the Catholic cemetery southwest of Fairfax.

One of the first school teachers in the township was Mrs. Keziah
McDowell, who taught in a private house. The first school building was
erected in 1855 on the place where the Elm Grove school now stands. The
first teacher who taught in a school building was a Mr. Eckerman, who
boarded around. The families who had children attending school at that
time were the McKinnons, the Listebargers, and the Hodges.

The first reaping machine in this part of the county was purchased by
William Ure at Chicago in the summer of 1847, and was a hand-raking
machine. Mr. Ure drove with an ox team to Chicago and returned with a
machine in time for cutting the grain that summer. After he got started
all the neighbors helped and the machine was run night and day until
the season was over and the grain harvested.

The Scotch families were United Presbyterians, and for many years
attended church in Cedar Rapids. In May, 1858, the Presbyterian church
was organized and established in Scotch Grove. The fiftieth anniversary
of the establishment of this church was celebrated in 1908, and the
paper read by Miss Jennie G. Mitchell, daughter of James Mitchell, now
residing in Cedar Rapids, gives a full history of the church and of
many of the old settlers of this county, and is herewith inserted in
full:

"THE ORIGIN OF FAIRFAX U. P. CHURCH

     "The first settlers in this part of Linn county, Iowa, were
     Robert and Jane Ure, who, with a family of grown children,
     came here in the spring or summer of 1841. The children were
     John, Margaret, James, William, Jane, Robert, Walter, and
     David. The family had emigrated from Scotland in 1838 and
     spent the intervening years near Springfield, Ohio. But land
     was high in the old settlements and they came 'west' where
     they could enter government land, settling, or at first
     camping, on the same ground where this church is built. Log
     houses were soon erected and some land entered and a few
     years later a brick house was built, the first in this part
     of the country. The brick was made by the boys and the
     entire house erected without the assistance of any expert,
     the lime being hauled all the way from Muscatine. The Ure
     family did not leave their religion in the Auld Kirk in the
     Homeland, but during all their travels, whether they tarried
     or camped for only the night, the morning and evening
     sacrifice of family prayer was offered; and on Sabbath at
     noon the family were gathered and God's word read, followed
     by praise and prayer. Thus they kept God's holy day and
     worshiped in their own home until preaching could be
     obtained, and by searching the records of the First United
     Presbyterian church of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, we find that on
     the 9th day of September, 1850, a meeting was held and a
     petition forwarded to the Associate Presbytery of Iowa,
     asking for a supply of preaching, and in 1851 the
     congregation in Cedar Rapids was organized, the Ure family
     uniting with them.

     "The cheap land and plenty of timber attracted others, and
     in the early fifties the McKinnon family came from Scotland
     and settled in Linn county near Scotch Grove. In 1852 Samuel
     and Sarah Hall, with their large family, settled at Sisley's
     Grove, and in 1854 James Cleghorn, Sr., with his two
     children and John and Agnes Anderson. James Cleghorn and
     Agnes Anderson were brother and sister. James Cleghorn, Jr.,
     is still living near where they located and built their
     first home. Robert Brownlie and family now reside where the
     Anderson home was built. This same year (1854) Joseph and
     Margaret Humphrey and family came and settled south of
     Prairie Creek, and in the spring of 1855, James and John
     Mitchell with their wives and families, and later Walter
     Mitchell and John and Jane McGregor with their families of
     sons and daughters, and a few years later Moses Mitchell,
     all finding homes in and around Scotch Grove.

     "The Ure family, thus re-inforced, soon after began an
     effort to secure preaching at Scotch Grove. But who first
     proposed asking for preaching, or where the meeting was
     held, is not on record and can not be recalled, but a minute
     on the records of the Cedar Rapids church, dated May 25,
     1856, reads thus: 'The people of Scotch Grove presented a
     petition and were granted one-fourth of the pastor's time.'
     But by whom this petition was presented is not recorded.
     Another record reads: 'At a meeting of the United
     Presbyterian church of Kingston, held on Tuesday afternoon
     at four o'clock, July 6, 1858, the following paper was
     adopted: Action of the United Presbyterian congregation of
     Kingston in relation to the organization of a church at
     Scotch Grove, Linn County, Iowa. _Resolved_: that we approve
     of the organization with the understanding that they
     continue in connection with us as the same pastoral charge
     until otherwise ordered by the Presbytery.' But the name of
     the Presbytery is not mentioned. It is supposed that Joseph
     Humphrey carried the petition to Presbytery. The
     organization was granted and on the 12th day of August,
     1858, a meeting was held in the home of James and Mary Ure,
     a sermon preached and the congregation organized by Rev.
     Hugh Sturgeon. There were fifteen charter members, and the
     name given the congregation was 'Fairfax.' The names of all
     present can not be recalled, but we remember that John
     Beatty, who later with his family came to the neighborhood,
     brought Mr. Sturgeon and was present at this meeting. Three
     elders were elected, Joseph Humphrey, Alexander Johnson and
     James Mitchell. James Mitchell did not accept the office and
     at a later meeting James Ure was elected and with the other
     two, ordained and installed. Thus organized and equipped
     they began the work with high hopes and willing hands, if
     not much ready money. There being no public building which
     could be used for religious meetings, they were held in
     homes, most of the time in the home of Miss Margaret Ure.
     Rev. Sturgeon did not long remain and others came. Revs.
     Douthett, A. J. Allen, Sawhill, Fulton, and others. Doctor
     Roberts of the Covenanter faith preached a few times. One
     occasion is remembered when he was to preach in the home of
     Mr. Wadsworth, where Mr. and Mrs. William Russell now live.
     Heavy rains had fallen during the week and Prairie creek was
     over its banks, with the bridge either washed away or
     overflowed. Several families lived on the other side who
     must attend the service on the Sabbath, no thought of the
     high water being an excuse for staying at home. They wished
     to attend and were needed to assist with the singing. The
     names of three families are remembered: Dixon, Junk, and
     Humphrey. Among other plans some one suggested building a
     raft, whom we do not remember, but superintended by Andrew
     Mitchell the work was begun, and finished Saturday
     afternoon. Sabbath afternoon the families came in their
     wagons as far as the creek, where they were met by neighbors
     on this side, ferried across by Andrew Mitchell, and
     conveyed to the home of Mr. Wadsworth. After the service
     they were brought back to the place of crossing and again
     ferried over, all in a quiet way becoming the day and
     occasion. Thus obstacles were met and overcome with the
     persistent determination of people who retained some of the
     spirit of their invincible John Knox. But a school house was
     erected in the early sixties, known as the James Ure school
     house, and religious meetings were held here. If possible,
     preaching, if not, Sabbath school and prayer meeting until
     their first pastor, Rev. J. T. Torrence, came among them.

     "Shall we ask: Did the work prosper? How well, vines
     transplanted from the Scotch Grove church in Nebraska,
     Kansas, Colorado, Idaho and far-off California will testify.

     "Is it possible to over-estimate the courage and
     perseverance of our fathers and mothers, who began the work
     in this new country under the great difficulties and
     privations, and whose faith, as well as strength of arm, has
     made possible the privileges we, their children, enjoy? We
     trust we shall not forget, but to succeeding generations
     tell the heroism of the daily strife and the earnestness and
     value of the twice daily prayer, 'All honor to the builders
     of this Church.'

         'The world may sound no trumpets--ring no bells,
         The book of life the shining record tells.'

     "THE CHARTER MEMBERS

     "Fifty years is a longer time than the memory of most of
     those living runs. The span of life is not always, in fact
     not usually, lengthened to include events so wide apart in
     space of time.

     "Fifty years ago, the great Civil war had not been fought,
     and it was the hopes of those who held the welfare of their
     country nearest to their hearts that such a calamity might
     be averted. Fifty years ago, the memory of those two great
     national characters, Webster and Clay, whose eloquence and
     zeal postponed that great contest a decade, was fresh to the
     little band that bound themselves together here at Scotch
     Grove that they might have the privileges of a church home.

     "In May of 1858, the United Presbyterian church was formed
     by the union of the Associate Presbyterians and Associate
     Reform Presbyterian churches. In the fall of that same year,
     fifteen devoted Christian citizens organized the new
     congregation and called it the United Presbyterian Church of
     Fairfax, Iowa.

     "It is interesting to note that while these fifteen early
     pioneers were planning for the organization, Abraham Lincoln
     was debating with Douglas the merits of the Dred Scott
     decision.

     "These fifteen charter members were:

          "Samuel Hall and wife, Sarah Hall.
          "Joseph Humphrey and wife, Margaret Humphrey.
          "Alexander Johnson and wife, Janet McKinnon Johnson.
          "James Mitchell and wife, Margaret McArthur Mitchell.
          "John Mitchell and wife, Margaret Mitchell.
          "William McKinnon and wife, Janet McKinnon.
          "James Ure and wife, Mary Ure, and
          "Miss Margaret Ure.

     "Associated with these fifteen charter members in word and
     work were John McGregor and wife, Jane Robertson McGregor,
     who later became members of the new organization.

     "Of these persons, there are three still living--Mr. and
     Mrs. James Ure, who live at Denver, Colorado, and Mr. James
     Mitchell, who lives at Cedar Rapids, Iowa. [Mr. and Mrs. Ure
     are now deceased, 1910].

     "James and Margaret Ure were among the very earliest
     settlers in this community. They, with their parents, had
     come to Iowa in 1841, five years before the territory was
     admitted to statehood. Both were born in Scotland and came
     to America in 1838, settling near Springfield, Ohio, where
     they lived till they came west. In 1857 James Ure was
     married to Mary Kerr. She was born in March, 1835, in
     Mercer, Pennsylvania, where she spent her early childhood,
     later removing with her parents to Dubuque, Iowa. They began
     housekeeping on their farm just east of the grove, where
     they lived till April, 1892, when they moved to Denver,
     Colorado.

     "In September, 1879, Mr. Ure asked for his certificate of
     admission, which was granted. He was one of the ruling
     elders elected at the time of the organization.

     "Margaret Ure was born in Scotland in 1821. After coming to
     Scotch Grove she resided on the Ure homestead, now owned by
     Jas. Rogers. She was a woman of great abilities and was
     always liberal in giving of her time and means to the work
     of the church. The church building was not erected for some
     years after the organization of the congregation and her
     home was always open for the holding of services during this
     time. The pulpit furniture now in use was a gift of hers.
     She removed to Cedar Rapids in 1884, where she died. She was
     buried in the Fairfax cemetery.

     "James Mitchell, one of the three surviving charter members,
     and who now resides at Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was born March 3,
     1821, in Buchlyvie, Stirlingshire, Scotland. He came to
     America in 1851 and settled in New York state. July 8, 1853,
     he was married to Margaret McArthur and in July, 1855, came
     to Linn county, Iowa. Mrs. Mitchell was born June 8, 1823,
     and died June 20, 1904, at the age of 81 years and 12 days.

     "At the time Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell came west, in 1855, the
     railroad ran no farther west than to Rock Island. At this
     point they, in company with Margaret and William Ure, were
     compelled to cross the Mississippi river on the ice. It was
     here that they received their first initiation into the life
     of hardship and peril that fell to the life of the early
     pioneer. While crossing the river, the wheels of their dray
     began to cut through the ice. There was danger of the ice
     giving way and all being drowned, but by means of levers and
     props they were able to reach the Iowa shore in safety.

     "When Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell reached Scotch Grove, they took
     for their home a small log house some five or six rods
     southwest from the present church building, and with the
     munificent sum of ten dollars with which to furnish their
     home, started to carve out their career in the new country.
     With Mrs. Mitchell there was little thought of what her
     spring hat would be like, or what she should serve when it
     came her turn to give a Kensington to the ladies of the
     community. It would probably be some days before any money
     would find its way into the family purse, and those ten
     dollars must be guarded with jealous care. True, potatoes
     could be had, and Mr. Ure and his family had proven that the
     potato could be used as the sole article of diet for at
     least three months.

     "In 1898 they removed to Cedar Rapids, where four years ago
     Mrs. Mitchell died. She was buried at Fairfax cemetery. Mr.
     Mitchell is now eighty-seven years of age. He was elected to
     the office of ruling elder in December, 1879, which he
     filled till the time he removed to Cedar Rapids. July 8,
     1903, Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell celebrated their golden wedding.

     "John Mitchell came to America in 1853. Margaret McGregor
     Mitchell was born in Sterlingshire, Scotland, September 8,
     1831. In 1852 she came to America with her parents, settling
     in New York state. The following year she was married to
     Mr. John Mitchell and in 1855 came to Scotch Grove. Here
     they settled in a small log house near the present church
     lot. Robert Ure, father of James and Margaret Ure, had,
     during the time of the gold excitement in California, built
     three of these houses, the first being erected without the
     use of a nail.

     "Mr. Mitchell entered forty acres of land west of where the
     Conley school house now stands. After the school house was
     built, preaching services and Sabbath school were held
     there, and Mr. Mitchell was one of the most active in
     lending help and maintaining the services. He died January
     17, 1896, at Norway; she February 3, 1892. Both were buried
     in the Fairfax cemetery.

     "Alexander Johnson was born in Pennsylvania, his father
     coming to America from Ireland. On coming to Iowa he lived
     at Cedar Rapids for a time, where he teamed. Here he lost
     his first wife and was later married to Janet McKinnon, who
     was born in Bo'ness, Scotland, and came to America in 1845.

     "Mrs. Johnson owned some land at Que's Grove, now known as
     Quam's Grove. This she bought from the government. Mr.
     Johnson had money with which to build a house and they thus
     moved on the land, where they lived till the time of his
     death.

     "Mr. Johnson was elected to the office of ruling elder when
     the congregation was organized, and was at all times an
     active and persistent worker in the church. He had become
     attached to his early church home and was reluctant to
     leave. It may seem strange, but yet it is true, that the
     place where a person spends the best years of his life,
     where he has toiled and labored to make a home, becomes in
     old age, after he is compelled to lay down his labors, the
     spot that is dearest to him. He had seen the community grow
     and develop, and as it had grown, his hopes had opened.

     "Some time prior to his death, the members of his family
     wanted to remove to Washington, Iowa. He could not entertain
     the thought of leaving his old home community, whose growth
     and development had meant so much to him, and in a
     conversation with a member of the congregation remarked that
     he had said, 'If they take me away from here, it will be in
     my coffin, but now I have given my consent to go.'

     "He was not permitted to make the change. During the latter
     part of his life he was confined to his bed. He died at
     Norway, having reached the age of eighty-four years. Mrs.
     Johnson died three years ago at Washington, Iowa.

     "Joseph Humphrey was born in New York state, January 19,
     1816, and when quite young his parents removed to Butler
     county, Pennsylvania. In 1836 he was married to Margaret
     Gill. She was born May 30, 1818, in Butler county,
     Pennsylvania. They came to Iowa May 5, 1855, and settled
     near Norway.

     "In the church he occupied the highest office to which a
     private member can be called by the voice of the
     congregation, that of ruling elder, being chosen elder at
     the organization of the congregation. He had a high sense of
     the responsibility of his office, viewing it as one of
     divine authority. It was his study, as a steward of God, to
     fulfill its duties and maintain its authority. He was
     punctual and regular in attendance at all the meetings of
     the congregation and gave largely of his means and time in
     forwarding its interests. He believed that the minister was
     worthy of his hire, and rather than neglect this duty he
     would let his boys go barefooted to church. He died December
     5, 1871, at the age of fifty-six years. Mrs. Humphrey died
     May 22, 1900, eight days before her eighty-second birthday.
     Both were buried in Fairfax cemetery.

     "Samuel Hall was born March 29, 1806, in Westmoreland
     county, Pennsylvania. His wife, Sarah Jobe Hall, was born
     October 8, 1808, in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania. In April
     of 1851 they came to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and entered land
     just west of that place, where they lived till their removal
     to Cedar Rapids in 1883. Mrs. Hall died March 10, 1886, and
     Mr. Hall on the 13th, three days later. Both were buried in
     the same grave in Sisley Grove cemetery. They were one of
     the four couples mentioned here, who celebrated their golden
     wedding.

     "Mr. and Mrs. William McKinnon were born in Scotland and
     were married before coming to America. They came to Scotch
     Grove at an early date, about 1852. For a time they lived
     with David McKinnon, east of the grove, and later moving to
     their new home north of Norway. Moved to the western part of
     the state and there died.

     "During the early days of the new congregation, Mr. McKinnon
     rendered valuable services as leader in the singing. His
     clear and distinct voice could be heard and followed with
     ease by the body of the congregation.

     "Mr. and Mrs. John McGregor were both born in Scotland, he
     May 11, 1801, in Callander, she August 13, 1806, in Bo'ness.
     They came to America in 1852, settling in New York, and in
     1857 came to Iowa where they settled on a farm west of the
     grove. Mr. McGregor was active in the work of the church and
     especially in the raising of funds for the new church
     building. Both were loyal supporters of the church, and were
     among those who kept their membership in the congregation
     till the time of their death.

     "The same vessel that brought them to America brought Mr.
     Jas. Mitchell. It was a sailing vessel and required six
     weeks to cross the ocean. This past summer their
     great-granddaughters made the voyage in the Lusitania in
     less than five days.

     "In 1877 they celebrated their golden wedding at their home,
     the same home they chose when first coming to Scotch Grove.
     Mr. McGregor died November 8, 1894, at the age of
     ninety-three years, the greatest age reached by any of the
     early members. August 13, 1880, Mrs. McGregor died, being
     just seventy-four years old. Both were buried in the Fairfax
     cemetery.

     "Conditions then and now are quite different. Railroads were
     not yet built into the community. At one time the produce
     had to be hauled to Davenport and Muscatine. It took a week
     to make the trip and when one got back home, little was left
     to encourage another trip. There were no roads in many
     places, and the oxen, which were often used in those days,
     frequently left the wagon stuck in some slough. Before
     railroads were built into Cedar Rapids, a steamboat came up
     the river from the Mississippi, bringing groceries and
     dry-goods and carrying the produce back. No money could be
     had for the grain and stock. One must take in exchange for
     them groceries and dry-goods. The panic of 1857 had not yet
     spent its force. Such were the conditions surrounding the
     early pioneers when the congregation was organized.

     "These members were not only pioneers in carving out homes
     in a new country, but they were pioneers of the faith.
     Religious services, Sabbath school and prayer meetings were
     held at Conley school house, at Norway, and at Livermore
     school house, besides those held at the church. They
     cherished the hope and faith in the divine which they had
     brought with them to the new country, and were persistent in
     offering to all who might come, the advantages of the
     sanctuary.

     "The early pioneers are always men of firm faith, sturdy and
     strong in their beliefs, set in their opinions. It is not to
     be wondered at, that when the question of where to erect the
     new church building arose, there were differences of
     opinion. Some wanted it located at Brownlie's corner, some
     at Conley's school house and some just west of the present
     site. It was at such times that William Ure stepped into the
     threatened breach and by his calm counsel brought unity to
     the opposing opinions. Although not a member of the Fairfax
     congregation Mr. Ure rendered services as valuable as any of
     its members in giving financial aid and in other ways.

     "Of these fifteen charter members, Mr. and Mrs. James
     Mitchell, James and Margaret Ure, William McKinnon and John
     Mitchell were all born and lived during their childhood in
     the same community in Scotland. They were all baptized by
     the Rev. Mr. Russell, and they attended the same church and
     school. In coming west to the new country they chose out a
     beautiful spot, fertile and productive. During the fifty
     years, within the memory of one of the charter members, land
     that was bought from the government for $1.25 per acre has
     been sold for $150 per acre.

     "Four of these couples, Mr. and Mrs. Jas. Mitchell, Mr. and
     Mrs. Samuel Hall, Mr. and Mrs. Jas. Ure, and Mr. and Mrs.
     John McGregor, have celebrated their golden weddings. Of
     these early pioneers of Scotch Grove, one has passed the age
     of ninety years, six have passed the age of eighty years,
     and but two died before reaching the age of seventy, a
     beautiful commentary upon their rugged and sturdy character
     and habits."


BOULDER TOWNSHIP

Boulder township is located in the northern part of the county and
despite its name is one of the most fertile and productive portions of
the county. The surface is generally rolling, dotted in an early day
with excellent groves of native timber. Buffalo creek in the days
before windmills were in common use was a much prized stream which was
used by farmers near and far, for the use of their stock. William
Wagner is supposed to have made the first settlement in 1850. He was
shortly followed by William McQueen and Silas Edington. Later came the
following named persons: John Wagner, Will Ward, H. B. Brown, Frank
Cooly, J. Wilds, J. Barnhardt and Ben Harrison. In the early fifties
came an itinerant Methodist minister, John Bell, and organized a small
congregation, services being held in a school house near the present
site of Prairieburg. The John McQueen grist mill which began operation
about 1854 on Buffalo creek, a mile southwest of Prairieburg, was a
noted mill in its day and was largely patronized by the early settlers.
The town of Prairieburg was named by Henry Ward, the first postmaster.
The first house was a log structure built by Joe Barnhardt in 1853. N.
Parsons erected the second house and Henry Wayne the third, which was a
store building where he opened a store. In 1856, Will Wagner started a
shoe shop, and other buildings, such as hotels and blacksmith shops
came later. The recent advent of the railroad has boomed the town and
the price of land has increased greatly. A number of the early settlers
and their descendants are still land owners in this township,
Coquillette, Whitney, Paul, O'Rourke, Carpenter, Walker, McQueen,
Burke, Rundle, Pillard, Nelson, Lacy, Leonard, Le Clerc, Smith,
Cushman, Hill, Soesbe, Garvis, Drexler, Tear, Considine, Matsel, and
other well known families.


CLINTON TOWNSHIP

Clinton township, with a population of 1,000 people, located in the
western tier of townships, has a rich, productive soil and has been
farmed continuously for sixty years and the soil shows no sign of
deterioration. The farmers residing in Clinton township have well
improved farms, good roads and a number of fine school houses and
churches. For many years the road known as the Toledo road, as well as
the Marengo road, were the two chief thoroughfares for travelers, gold
seekers, and others, and consequently it was early well advertised.

Among some of the early settlers in this township may be mentioned John
Conley, Hiram Usher, Joe Brown, Dyer Usher, George Buchanan, Reese and
the Langhams, and scores of others who came here in the '40s.

James Yuill, Henry Maurer, John Fox, Whiteneck, Sisley, Kuhn, Wieneke,
Lederman, O'Connell, the Miller family, Misners, Scotts, Swetts, Hall,
Snell, and many others of the early settlers came here in an early day,
building up the community. They have long since passed away leaving
their children and grandchildren large tracts of productive land.

Sisley Grove was at a very early time a place where all the settlers,
as well as travellers, congregated. The grove at that time was much
larger than it is at present, and many of the farmers adjoining owned
small tracts of land in this grove where they cut rails and fence posts
for their farms during the winter.

Here is also located a cemetery where many of the old settlers are
buried, and at an early day a church was built at which the early
pioneers congregated once a week to hear the word of God preached. In
the absence of any regular preacher frequently the pioneer farmers
preached to the congregations. This church was abandoned some years ago
and the congregation has since worshiped at Fairview, a few miles
further east.

Here, also, was located Kuhn's blacksmith shop and hotel. Kuhn was a
queer old fellow, who not only was an expert blacksmith but the only
one for miles who was competent to shoe oxen, and consequently during
the winter months he was a very busy man. Kuhn not only was a good
horseshoer and blacksmith, but he was a dentist as well and pulled
teeth when blacksmithing was slack. At one time he pulled a tooth for
an old settler with an instrument used in those days and as it was
pretty severe he gave a drink of whiskey to stop the pain. After the
fellow fully recovered his senses the tooth ached as before and the
patient learned that the dentist had pulled the wrong tooth and so
informed the blacksmith, to which the blacksmith replied, "That will be
easy to remedy, just take another drink and we will go at it again, and
you will not be out very much as my charges are only ten cents a
tooth." Old Mr. Kuhn seemed to know the wants of the community, for he
kept a barrel of whiskey in his blacksmith shop and sold the stuff at
thirty cents a gallon, and served free drinks to anyone on paying his
bill. The hotel was not a modern kind of a house, but was generally
full, as travellers in those days were plentiful. The old man also sold
feed to travellers and consequently he generally got a little something
out of every traveller who passed by Sisley Grove.

The grove was named in honor of the first settler who owned most of the
land, on which the grove is situated. During the early '50s and '60s
Clinton township produced more wheat, it is said, than any other
township in the county, all of which was hauled to Cedar Rapids.


BUFFALO TOWNSHIP

Buffalo township was first settled by George C. Perkins, who came here
in 1839 and made a claim which he occupied thereafter during his
lifetime. In the early days it was well wooded and consequently much of
this land was sold in small strips to adjoining farmers.


GRANT TOWNSHIP AND WALKER

For the following interesting sketch of the early settlement of
northwestern Linn county we are under obligations to Justin Barry,

Grant township, forming the northwest corner of Linn county, was
organized in 1872 as the result of a struggle over the levying of a tax
in aid of the construction of a railroad. The B., C. R. & N., since
incorporated into the Rock Island system, had projected a line from
Cedar Rapids north toward the Minnesota line. Washington township, then
embracing much more territory than at present, had voted a five per
cent tax in aid of the road. Those living in the northern portion of
the township rebelled, and in an effort to escape the tax petitioned
for a division of the territory and the formation of a new township.
They succeeded in the latter effort and the new township was designated
Grant, in honor of General Grant, who was then president. However, the
people did not escape the tax, and some of those who most vigorously
opposed it later embarked in business in the new town of Walker, which
sprung up with the coming of the railroad, and thus their defeat became
in fact the foundation for modest fortunes, which came from the large
territory and the equally large profits of pioneer business days.

As the earlier settlers sought out the timbered sections regardless of
the quality of the land, what is now Grant township, comprised as it is
almost wholly of prairie, was one of the last portions of the county to
be developed. Some few settlers came early, but progress generally was
slow. A family named Norris was the first to settle within its
territory, being already located along what is now its southern border
when John K. Speake and family came in 1840. The Norrises have since
disappeared and no one seems to know whither they went. James Buforde
Speake is now the oldest living settler in the township, and though
past eighty years of age he continues to operate the farm in section 19
on which his father filed when the family arrived here from Illinois in
1840.

Other settlers came at long intervals, but for many years after the
arrival of the first it was predicted with great assurance that the
northern portion of the township never would be settled but would
always remain a wilderness. And yet this valley, including the present
town site of Walker, lying north of what in the early days was called
Wright's Grove, now Fox's Grove, must have presented an attractive
picture and one of rare beauty in its wild state, viewed from the
surrounding hills, a little creek winding its way through the center,
flanked all about by great rolling ridges and fringed on either bank
with willows, with here and there a giant oak towering above all else.

William Davis settled in the southwest portion of the township in 1841,
and on his farm in about 1850 or a little earlier was laid out the
first cemetery in the township. It is still in use for that purpose and
many of the monuments erected in the early days bear quaint
inscriptions. Mr. Davis died in 1866, leaving a large estate to his
sons, Hezekiah and Edward, who carried on extensive farm operations.
The former kept a pack of hounds and for many years scoured the country
for miles around in search of wolves. The Davises later met with
reverses and left the county years ago shorn of a large share of the
princely estate, which once had embraced many hundreds of acres of land
in Benton and Linn counties.

E. D. Hazeltine, who died only a few weeks ago at his home in Center
Point, was another early settler in the southern portion of the
township, and he was long active in all its interests. He served for
some time in the early days as a county commissioner. During the '50s
numerous pioneer families arrived, including those of Thomas Fee, W. C.
Ring, C. G. and Benjamin Gitchell, W. S. Bliss, Chorydon Gilchrist,
Christian Iehl, and others.

Following the close of the Civil war development was more rapid, a
number of soldiers fresh from the service joining the pioneers in their
work of subduing the wilderness. In 1873 when the railroad arrived
settlement had reached the northern border of the township, where James
A. North, Walker Purviance, William Moses and others were located. The
building of the railroad brought the establishment of a new town on
section 4, which was called Walker, in honor of W. W. Walker, then
chief engineer and afterward superintendent and receiver of the road.

James K. Hotchkin built the first business building, opening a general
store, and he was also appointed as the first postmaster. The second
business building was erected by Theo. Hamblin, present mayor of the
town, who engaged in the grocery business. O. C. Barnes built a hotel
on the site now occupied by the Walker _News_ office, and Fred Hoffman
erected the store building now occupied by S. Liddle. The first
residence was built by C. G. Gitchell, who leased his farm in section
21 and engaged in the lumber and grain business in partnership with
Fred Hoffman, and Mrs. Gitchell was the first woman resident of the
town. Messrs. Gitchell and Hoffman prospered greatly in business,
amassing modest fortunes, and both remained for many years among the
leaders in business affairs. Mr. Gitchell later represented his county
for two terms in the lower house of the General Assembly of Iowa.

The town grew steadily and at once became an important market point,
tapping a wide territory of rich farming country, and for many years it
has been recognized as the best shipping point on the Decorah division
of the Rock Island, barring only one or two of the larger cities. The
farmers soon turned their attention largely to dairying, and in the
town now is one of the finest creamery plants in the state, "Walker"
butter having gained a wide fame in the city markets.

Municipal affairs have been wisely and economically administered ever
since the incorporation of the town in 1891, when the following were
chosen as the first officers: Mayor, W. A. Jones; councilmen, C. G.
Gitchell, J. P. Bross, H. J. Nietert, J. N. Keys, Theo. Hamblin and P.
L. Hutchins; recorder, O. C. Swartz; treasurer, M. B. Dodge; assessor,
E. R. Wheeler; marshal, J. M. Peyton. Walker now has a pretty park
embracing about two blocks of ground, a complete municipal water-works
system affording fire protection to all portions of the town, and a
well equipped fire department. The water-works system has just been
re-enforced by the sinking of a second deep well, affording an
inexhaustible supply of water, and the installation of a second pumping
equipment.

The town's graded school system has reached a high standard of
efficiency, and its graduates rank well as teachers and as students in
higher institutions. The school has four departments, all of them
crowded to their full capacity, the enrollment including many tuition
scholars. Several thousand dollars have already been set aside as the
foundation of a fund for the erection of a new brick school building,
which will be a necessity within a few years.

The town is well supplied with churches, having four protestant and one
Catholic society. In the order of their organization they are:
Methodist Episcopal, Free Methodist, Catholic, Presbyterian, Christian.
The first church organized in the town was in 1874 by the Wesleyan
Methodist, but that denomination has since passed from the field.

That the town and surrounding country are prosperous and rapidly
growing in wealth is shown by the fact that Walker now boasts of two
strong banks having resources reaching a half a million dollars, and
with deposits steadily increasing. Its business men are enterprising
and progressive.

Regularly laid out, its streets lined with shade trees, bordering
permanent walks and well kept lawns, the town presents a pretty
appearance, and town officials and citizens seem to vie with each other
in their efforts to maintain its reputation as being one of the
prettiest towns in the county.


MAINE TOWNSHIP

We are indebted to a loyal citizen of the county for the following
historical sketch of one of the finest districts in the county--Maine
township. Dr. Ward Woodbridge has treated sympathetically the early
days in and around Central City. He long has lived there, has been a
potent factor in the development of his community, and knows whereof he
speaks.

     Maine township geographically is located in the northeast
     corner of Linn county, being in the second row of townships
     from both the north and east.

     Its shape is an irregular triangle, containing forty-seven
     square miles, making it one-third larger than the average
     township. This is due to an early arrangement whereby a
     portion of Buffalo township became a part of Maine. The
     Wapsie river divides Buffalo township nearly in the middle.
     In its early history the larger number of people resided
     south of the river, as there were no bridges in those days,
     and the river held a high stage of water, making it
     difficult to cross. These people finally asked to be
     attached to Maine township for administrative purposes, and
     all that portion of Buffalo on the south side of the river
     was made a part of Maine, and has never been restored.

     The Wapsie river runs along the northeastern border of
     Maine, and is the dividing line between it and Buffalo.

     Along the river, and from one to three miles in width on
     either side, the land is somewhat hilly, sandy, and has been
     heavily timbered. When the more level country is reached it
     becomes a gently undulating plain, rich black loam and very
     productive.

     As we turn in retrospect, seeing its growth and development,
     we can see the work of the hardy and determined pioneers on
     every hand. It was they who blazed the way. It was they who
     built this Appian way of progress. It was their devotion and
     privation, patiently endured, that have caused not two, but
     myriads of blades of grass to grow where hitherto the one
     blade was trampled under foot by the roving Indian and
     buffalo, and although their forms have vanished and their
     voices are stilled, and the hands roughened by honest toil
     lie quiet, yet their work lives after them. They left that
     imprint on both descendants and administration which makes
     of the Maine township citizenship today a sturdy,
     hard-headed class, whose public opinion always crystallizes
     on the side of righteousness, of truth and justice. Its
     people never have to apologize for their course.

     Probably the first white settler was John Jenkins, who came
     in 1838 and settled on the farm adjoining Central City known
     as the Ormus Clark farm. In 1839 Joseph Clark bought the
     farm of Jenkins, he being a son-in-law of Clark. It lies to
     the southwest of Central City, and a portion of it lies
     within the corporation. It is now owned by C. C. Crane.

     In the winters of 1838-1840 a few trappers wintered along
     the banks of the Wapsie, but the names of no permanent
     settlers are recorded.

     In the spring of 1840 two young men, natives of Maine,
     landed in Maine township. They had left their state two
     years before and stopped at Peoria, Illinois, working there
     through the summer, and going south in the winter where they
     worked in the cotton yards of New Orleans. Returning from
     New Orleans in the spring of 1840 they bought three yoke of
     cattle, a big prairie plow, and what other necessaries they
     needed, and headed for the Mississippi river. Crossing it
     they drove on and on until arriving one evening at the place
     known as "Jordan's Grove" they camped for the night. The
     next morning they cooked breakfast, and while one of them
     went out to gather up the cattle, the other took his
     bearings, and when the cattle were brought up he had the
     plow out of the wagon. On inquiry from his partner as to
     what he was about he said, "This looks good to me. Hitch
     onto the plow." These two young men were L. D. Jordan and Ed
     McKinney. They broke enough to hold their claims, went to
     Dubuque and filed on them, returned, built cabins, went back
     to Maine and married sisters, returned and made homes, and
     Mr. Jordan lived his whole life on the spot where he
     unloaded the plow, dying there in 1890. McKinney moved from
     the neighborhood some years before his death. They both
     lived to be old men.

     In 1840 the Heaton family came, and P. A. and Will Heaton
     still live in Central City, together with two or three of
     the women of the family.

     In October, 1844, Chandler Jordan arrived at his brother's
     place. He remained all night, and in the morning got on a
     horse and rode north through the grove to the brow of the
     hill overlooking the Wapsie valley.

     It was beautiful Indian summer. All was purple, yellow, and
     gold, and the blue-joint grass stood as high as the back of
     his horse all the way down the valley. He gazed fascinated,
     rode slowly down the valley of a small creek that meandered
     from its source in the grove, to the river. In a level place
     on the bank of the creek he stopped, staked out a claim,
     returned, went to Dubuque and filed on it, came back and
     began improvements.

     He broke the ground and raised crops, and in the spring of
     1847 built a cabin on the spot where he first dismounted,
     and married Sarah D. Waterhouse in June. They went at once
     to the cabin and began housekeeping. Later they built more
     commodious quarters, and in 1860 erected the brick house in
     which they both died in 1909.

     Harvey Powell came in 1844 also, and entered a fine tract of
     land on the ridge west of Central City, where he lived to a
     good old age.

     In 1846 N. C. Gillilan came; Jennings Crawford in 1854, and
     the Haas family in the early fifties.

     About this time settlers began coming in so rapidly that
     honorable mention can not be made of all of them, even if
     they could be traced. It can readily be seen that the
     earliest settlers coming from the state of Maine gave the
     name to the township. They were a sturdy lot of pioneers,
     determined to win success from their surroundings. They knew
     no such word as fail or can't. They knew no surcease from
     labor, but toiled on without murmur or complaint.

     Markets were a long way off, Dubuque and Muscatine being the
     principal places where they sold their produce. It took four
     days to take a load to Dubuque and bring one back. They
     never made the trip with empty wagons. There were no
     bridges. The roads ran across the virgin prairie, and often,
     when sloughs were bad, they had to take off part of the
     load, drive through a bad place, unload what they had hauled
     over and return for the rest, thus delaying their journey.

     Finally the Northwestern road came to Cedar Rapids in 1859,
     and later a road to Marion and Springville, bringing, as
     they felt, markets to their very doors.

     They turned the virgin soil, sowed, reaped, mowed, and
     garnered the fruits of their labor year after year, early
     and late alike, working with the primitive tools of that day
     when most of the work was done by main strength instead of
     machinery. They formed from necessity those habits of saving
     every thing which, with many, later resulted in an abundance
     for the rainy day. These early privations, sturdy devotion
     to the work, with a fidelity well worth emulation has
     brought its rewards in one of the richest agricultural
     regions on earth.

     They saw the steady advancement of material things as a
     reward for their patient toil. They established schools and
     churches, overcoming as rapidly as possible the drawbacks
     and inconveniences of pioneer life.

     They made the way of the transgressor a hard one, and when
     law breakers and horse thieves escaped through some sharp
     practice, they took the law in their own hands and rid the
     country for all time of the horse thief and general law
     breaker, thereby putting a premium on honesty.

     The villages of Waubeek and Central City were established in
     the usual way. Blacksmith shops, stores, and post offices
     being a necessity, they were established on the banks of the
     Wapsie river, Central City on the north side of the river
     just at the north line of the township, and Waubeek five
     miles southeast on the south bank of the river.

     Some dams were built across the river at both places and saw
     mills established to saw lumber for the pioneer houses to
     displace the log cabin. These were followed by grist mills
     to make flour for the settlers, and for many years the mills
     at both places were run at their full capacity. Gradually
     wheat was abandoned as a product, and the people were able
     to buy a better grade of flour than the home mills could
     make. They were allowed to run down and were neglected until
     finally the mill at Waubeek was allowed to fall in the
     river. The last vestige of its site is gone.

     The mill at Central City has run until lately, grinding the
     feed for the farmers, but it, too, has quit, the wheel is
     still, and the busy scenes about its doors are but memories
     of its great convenience and usefulness to those it served
     so well.

     After years of quiet and peaceful pursuits the mutterings of
     civil war began to be heard. The lowering clouds portending
     the storm made the heart of many a pioneer mother beat with
     anxiety as she felt that if it came she must lay a son on
     the altar.

     Finally when the storm burst on the community Maine township
     was not backward in sending its quota of men, something like
     twenty of its best sons enlisting in the Twentieth Iowa, and
     others in the Sixteenth, the Twenty-fourth, and other
     scattered regiments.

     With improved market facilities and the high prices of war
     times the farmers rapidly accumulated a competence.

     The war over, the soldiers returned to peaceful pursuits,
     the young men of other states began to hunt up locations,
     and many of them found their way to Maine township.

     Farms were rapidly opened up after 1865, and it was not many
     years until all the open prairie was turned, fenced, put to
     crops, homes built, and the whole face of the township
     changed to a busy, peaceful, and prosperous scene.

     In its early days there was little chance or opportunity for
     religious gatherings. It was difficult to find ministers to
     conduct funerals, and church services were a long way apart,
     both in meeting places and appointment.

     In 1854 a Methodist class was established at Central City,
     then called Clarksford. In 1856 the Jordan's Grove Baptist
     church was organized, and in 1858 the Congregational church
     at Central City was established.

     In 1855 the village of Waubeek was laid out, and for many
     years was a fine trading point. Its stores, together with
     its mill, did a fine business. It has one of the finest
     store buildings in Linn county.

     In 1856 the village of Central City was surveyed, and the
     same year the dam was built across the river where it now
     stands.

     In 1887 the Illinois Central railroad built a line from
     Manchester to Cedar Rapids, running it through Central City.
     This little city, exactly half way between Manchester and
     Cedar Rapids, at once began to grow as soon as it was
     certain the railroad would be built.

     This road was a great boon to the north part of Linn county,
     as before that Marion was its nearest market, and many had
     to haul their produce twenty miles to reach it.

     Central City now has six hundred people. It has fourteen
     business houses, three churches, a solid bank, a fine school
     doing full twelve-grade work.

     The post office is third class, with four rural routes. It
     is the distributing point for freight for all the
     surrounding country, with large hog, cattle, hay, and grain
     buying facilities. It has two lumber yards, and from 1,200
     to 2,000 tons of coal are shipped in here every year.

     The village of Waubeek has no railroad and has made no
     advance for the past twenty years. It has four stores, post
     office, creamery, two churches, good schools, and fine stone
     quarries.

     It is not necessary to enlarge on this history. It is
     doubtless a repetition of the history of many other
     townships, but we, its citizens, have a local pride in its
     beauty, its bounty, its prosperity, its boundless
     hospitality. No finer cattle, hogs, horses, sheep, and
     poultry can be found on the face of the earth than are
     raised in Maine township. The physical, moral, social,
     intellectual, and financial condition of the people is on a
     high plane, and shows a steady growth and development
     through all the years since the first settlement. Its people
     have laid aside the miserly habits made necessary by their
     early struggles, and there is literally nothing too good for
     them to have and enjoy. This prosperity is shown by the fine
     modern homes being built, or remodeled from the older ones,
     all over the township, with every modern convenience in the
     way of plumbing and heating, and furnished in the latest and
     best way. Commodious barns and outbuildings, tiling of wet
     places, and building of woven wire fences mark the advances
     of farm work, making every acre available for cultivation.

     The bounteous crops, the high prices of all farm produce,
     the solid improvements being made, the phenomenal price of
     land--and it is still soaring--all mark a prosperous, happy,
     and contented people, loyal, honest, industrious,
     hospitable, ready always to entertain the stranger within
     the gates. Farm life no longer carries with it the dreary
     isolation and monotony of early pioneer life. The work is
     done with modern machinery. Telephones extend to every home
     in the township. Rural delivery takes the mail each morning
     to their doors, and the latest literature is found on their
     library tables. They are in touch with every phase of life.
     The women no longer spin and weave, and then sew and knit,
     but buy ready made the best that is manufactured.

     When the day's work is done they come to town in their
     automobiles, the women gowned in the latest fashions, to
     enjoy an evening of social pleasure, engage in club work,
     society work, lodge work, and church work. The village of
     Waubeek has a ladies' improvement club, and they have built
     over a mile of fine cement sidewalk.

     As one rides over the great state of Iowa and sees its
     flocks and herds, its fine homes, cities, towns, and
     villages, the bounteous crops, and notes the intelligence
     and contentment of its people, we are led with the red men
     of virgin days to exclaim "E-A-WAH," the beautiful land, and
     no fairer spot can be found in its broad domain than Maine
     township, of which we are all proud to be residents and
     citizens.


JACKSON TOWNSHIP

Jackson township is in the north tier of townships. It is bounded on
the north by Buchanan county, on the east by Boulder township, on the
south by Maine and on the west by Spring Grove townships. It is well
watered by the Wapsie river as well as by Buffalo creek, both of which
streams traverse parts of the ground called for political purposes
Jackson township. The township is largely settled by Americans whose
ancestors located on these verdant prairies in the forties and fifties.
The township is supposed to have been named by David Sutton, in honor
of his patron saint Andrew Jackson. James Lytle came from Indiana and
took up a claim here in 1841. He brought his wife who was a daughter of
David Sutton, who located here in January, 1843, with a wife and nine
children. The first white child born in the township was Frances, a
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Lytle. Sam W. Justice came in 1845 and
erected a house on ground where now is the town of Paris, which was
staked out on the south bank of the Wapsie river on what is now
sections 19 and 20, township 86, range 6. Sam Chamberlain opened the
first store and established quite a trade, which later was shared by
Rob. C. Powell, who erected a more complete store building and provided
more pretentious quarters where he was besides store keeper the first
postmaster. Dan McCrellis and Anos Bond located on lands on which this
embryo town was started. Dave Long also saw fit to stop here in search
of a home as early as 1848.

Miss Pethenia Gray taught the first school about a half a mile west of
Paris in 1850. The first religious services were conducted by Rev.
Little at the home of Sam Justin. Jas. Nugent settled in section 12 in
the northeastern part of the county in 1847 at what for many years was
known as Nugent's Grove. Mr. Nugent was for many years justice, school
director, township trustee, and held other offices. He was a leader of
the republican party for many years and well known over the county. He
died a number of years ago, the widow passing away at an advanced age
in the fall of 1910. S. D. Mills settled here with his family in 1853,
followed the following spring by F. M. Philips who came from Illinois,
but returned again and permanently located in the county three years
later. The years from 1854-1857 were the most active in the matter of
land purchase in this township. In 1854 came Wm. Henderson of Scotch
descent from Canada with his family and located on lands a little to
the west of the present town of Coggon. A large number of the
descendants of this family are still large property owners and
respected and enterprising citizens of this township. E. L. Ware, Henry
Thorp, G. C. Edgerly and many others purchased lands and settled here
during these years. John Bruce in 1858 during the hard times had the
courage to erect a stone grist mill on Buffalo creek at the present
site of Coggon and this property later came into the possession of Amos
Green who operated the mill till 1876, when he erected a frame
structure. This mill was much appreciated by the settlers and it was a
busy place for many years. Up till the time of the Illinois Central
railway extension in 1887, the place was known as Green's Mill, later
called Nugent, after the postoffice, and then named Coggon. The first
store at Green's Mill was run by John Bruce, who ran this in connection
with his mill. The advent of railroads brought up the price of lands,
markets were offered for grain and rents at once advanced and since
that time the growth has been steady and healthful till Jackson
township is not excelled by any other community in the state.


LINN TOWNSHIP

Linn township, in the southeastern part of the county, on account of
its location was early settled by L. M. Kepler of Indiana, and G. A.
Yeisley of Pennsylvania, who came here as early as 1837. By 1840 a
large number had located in the township, such as J. C. Goudy, Dan
McCall, Isaac Kyle and Oliver Clark who had emigrated from Ohio, Benj.
Hoover, Alex Torrance, Jas. Varner, who had come from Pennsylvania;
Chancy Neal, Geo. House, William Perkins and others from the eastern
states. Sam Ellison had come from Ireland, and J. W. Walton from
England. The descendants of many of these early settlers are still
residents of the county, the owners of large farms, and of much
personal property.

It was not until 1852-1857 that settlers came in any large numbers from
the eastern states. Then nearly all the vacant lands which had not
gotten into the hands of speculators were for the most part taken up
and improved. Linn township was on the so-called Anamosa-Iowa City
road, as well as on the Marion-Muscatine road, two of the early
highways.

The township cannot boast of any towns with the exception of Paralta,
which is only a junction point of the Milwaukee system. The residents
trade at Mt. Vernon and Lisbon.

In this township can be found many descendants of the early settlers
and even a few of the original pioneers. The Yeisley, Needles, Clark,
Neal, Bussenbark, Ink, Leigh, Filloon, Ellison, Beechley, Chamberlain,
Stinger, Paul, Remington, Lacock, Stewart, Goudy, Boxwell, Kearns,
Ballard, Travis, and other well known early families are still owners
of valuable farms within the confines of the old township borders.


OTTER CREEK TOWNSHIP

Otter Creek township, containing thirty-six sections, situated nearly
in the center of Linn county, has been considered one of the best
farming communities in Iowa for years. The soil is excellent and there
has always been plenty of water in the streams for cattle, which also
affords good drainage for tilling purposes. During the last ten years
nearly every acre of unproductive land has been reclaimed by a thorough
system of drainage, so that now Otter Creek land sells at the top
notch.

The first settler was William Chamberlain, who located in what later
became Monroe township, in 1838. He is the father of the famous
Chamberlain family who have made a fortune out of the patent medicine
business in Des Moines. The children of William and Rachel Chamberlain
were Davis and Lowell, and four daughters named Mrs. Mary Snyder, Mrs.
Laura Weeks, Mrs. Lucy A. Taylor, and Isanna L. Chamberlain.

Other early settlers might be mentioned as follows: John Cochran,
George Cochran, Alexander Nevin, James Hemphill, William Ward, Nate
Reynolds, who came in the early '40s. Caleb Hendrix came, it is
thought, in 1838. Of him, it is said by John Lanning, that old Caleb
used to say that he made a claim and spread his tent on what became
Cedar Rapids, but that a lot of bloodthirsty and ferocious Indians
camped on the other side of the river and by their acts and grimaces
and the noise they made Caleb sized up the situation that this was a
case where it would be better to be a live coward than a dead hero and
he pulled up stakes and removed further north, going to a number of
places before he settled in Otter Creek township, where he finally
decided to make his home. Mr. Hendrix married a daughter of James
Hemphill in 1845 and for many years was a pillar in the Methodist
church and an enthusiastic Sunday school worker.

Among other early settlers might be mentioned Perry Oliphant and his
wife Susanna, as well as his sons Silas, Edward, John, William, and
Henry, and his daughters Lizzie, Mary, and Rillar. These came in 1839
or 1840. Another of the old, well respected families who came here in
the early '40s was the Neighbors. John Nevins erected the first saw
mill in 1845 near what later became the village of Lafayette. This mill
was later owned by John Yambert, James Greene, and A. Brenaman, still
later it came into the possession of Fred Notebohn, who added a grist
mill, and when the water gave out it was run by steam.

Other of the old settlers were James Wallace, Alfred Thomas, William
and Samuel Fleming, the Mounces, Seversons, Pences, Fishels, Browns,
Fees, Jackmans, Taylors, Chesmores, Hollenbecks, Andrews, Martins,
Metcalfs, and many others.

One of the first stores kept was in the fall of 1847 when Morris
Neighbor opened a small place in what was known as Shingle Town. This
name, it is said, came about for the reason that clapboards were made
in this vicinity.

John Carr, having married Neighbor's sister, also lived here for some
time. The postoffice for Otter Creek township was moved around among
the old settlers from time to time and was kept, of course, in the farm
houses. William Hunt seems to have been the first postmaster. The
office was afterwards removed and the postmastership held by Perry
Oliphant, and later again removed, with Richard Lanning in charge.
During the Civil war the postoffice was conducted by Yambert, Polley,
and Moller. It was around the postoffice and country store that
politics were discussed and news of the neighborhood commented upon,
and it was also here that the pioneer settlers became acquainted and
friendships were formed which continued through life. For this reason,
no doubt, the country postoffice and the country store did much in an
early day to lessen the hardships in pioneer life.

Otter Creek township was early visited by itinerary ministers, and as
early as 1853 a Christian church was organized. William Kalb, John
Yambert, and others being some of the first evangelical preachers in
this part of the county. One of the first county meetings of this
church was held at the home of George Cochran as early as 1859. The
Evangelical church was later organized in this township and some of the
early ministers in this denomination were Rev. Borchart, Rev. Maerz,
Rev. Gerhart, Rev. Mayne, Rev. Brecher.


COLLEGE TOWNSHIP

College township is situated in the southern tier of townships in the
county, the southern boundary being the county line between Johnson and
Linn counties, while on the east and west respectively are Fairfax and
Putnam townships. College township is well watered and well drained by
several water courses, the principal ones being the Cedar river,
Hoosier creek, and Prairie creek. It contains no towns of any size but
most of its traffic is now conducted by the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City
electric line running from Cedar Rapids to Iowa City. Much of the
cream, milk and other products of the farm are shipped daily over this
line to Cedar Rapids; since the construction of this line land in
College township has gone up in price and the beautiful farm houses,
magnificent and well tilled fields speak well for the population of
this part of the county.

Some of the old settlers of College township are the following: Isaac
Smith, Phillip Smith, Dr. J. H. Smith, James Smith, and others of the
Smith family who came here in the early '50s. During the next few years
came John Lagore, Joseph Custer, Jacob Inbody, the Garnett family,
Thomas Philipson, Horn, Henry Rogers, Fritz family, James Snyder, W. F.
Minor, Joshua Minor, Sam Minor, the Bakers, and many others.

One of the first Baptist churches was erected at Rogers Grove, and a
large number of the early settlers in this community belonged to that
denomination.


SPRING GROVE TOWNSHIP

BY A. W. FISHER

Spring Grove township is situated in the northern tier of townships in
Linn county. It is bordered on the north by Newton township, Buchanan
county, on the east by Jackson, on the south by Otter Creek, and on the
west by Grant. The land is generally an undulating prairie excepting a
strip about two miles wide beginning at the northwest corner of the
township in section six, and extending in a southeasterly direction to
section twenty-four on the east side of the township, through which the
Wapsipinicon river flows. The land near the river on both sides is not
only hilly, but consists of a light sandy soil, and was almost covered
with a heavy growth of timber in the early pioneer days. Back from the
river about one mile the land is prairie and has a deep black loam.

The early settlements of Spring Grove township were connected with the
settlements in the neighboring townships, and divided themselves into
three groups. The first one was on the north side of the Wapsipinicon
river, while another settlement was made in the southeastern part of
the township in what is called West Prairie, and the third settlement
was in the western part of the township. The earliest settlers located
along the Wapsipinicon river where the soil is of a poorer quality than
it was on the open prairie. The reason for their choice was to secure
timber for their buildings and for fuel. In a few cases the settlers
were grouped around springs that furnished them with water.

Game was abundant in those days and this helped the pioneer during the
long cold winters. Large herds of deer were often seen along the timber
near the river and on the prairies. Wolves were too plentiful to suit
the settler as they prowled around his cabin during the night and
carried off poultry whenever the chance offered. Panthers were rarely
seen but were too numerous for the more timid in those days. Often
cattle and hogs were missing and their loss was attributed to the work
of the panther. The early settlers of Spring Grove township did not
escape the discomforts of the average pioneer. Their houses were, at
the best, rudely constructed of logs, and the stoves used in those days
were very poor. Many of the old settlers have informed me that their
coffee, when they were lucky enough to secure it, was often frozen
after being placed on the breakfast table.

The first settlement was on the north side of the Wapsipinicon river
around two springs. One of them was in a grove in Newton township,
Buchanan county, and the other one a short distance southeast in a
grove in our township. To distinguish them the early pioneers called
them the Upper and Lower Spring Grove. The name of Spring Grove then
came in general use for the entire settlement and was adopted by our
settlers as the name of their township.

[Illustration: A VIEW OF CEDAR RAPIDS FROM THE ISLAND]

[Illustration: RAILROAD YARDS AT CEDAR RAPIDS]

The first settler in Spring Grove township was Leonard Austin, who with
his family settled in section one of our township in the spring of
1845, and erected the first building from rough unhewn logs taken from
the timber surrounding his building site. Mr. Austin was followed by A.
J. Ward, who with his family settled near Mr. Austin during the fall of
that year. Two years later, in 1847, Josiah Walton and Rev. Wm.
Phillips settled as near neighbors to these hardy pioneers. These were
soon followed by the Reeces, Holmans, Longs, McPikes, Peytons, Carsons,
Whisenands, McKees, Fays, and Waltons, who settled in the northern part
of our township and in the southern part of Newton township in Buchanan
county, and who are remembered as the early pioneers.

The early settlers of the southeastern part of the township were the
Bices, Andersons, Saxtons, Leathermans, Plummers, Swaims, Frank Dorr,
E. B. Fisher, Bumgardners, Benedicts, McBurneys, Nutting, Carpenters,
and Jordans. These settlers formed part of a settlement that extended
into Jackson township. They located there during the early part of the
'50s. About the same time the western part of the township south of the
Wapsipinicon river was settled. Those early settlers were Edwin
Jeffreys, A. G. Kibbe, Elmer and J. E. Atwood, father and son, Chas.
Cook and sons, Edwin, Enos, George, and Charles, and George Parkhurst.
All these early pioneers took an active part in helping to develop the
new country.

In regard to religious worship the people of Spring Grove may be
likened to the Puritans of the early colonial period, as among the
earliest settlers came Rev. Wm. Phillips, a minister of the gospel who
at first conducted meetings in his own home, and later became a
"circuit rider," holding meetings every Sunday either in some private
house or in a school house. The Christian organization that is now at
Troy Mills was organized by Henry Holman during the summer of 1853 in
John W. McKee's house near what is now Troy Mills. Mr. Holman preached
the first sermon and continued as pastor until the organization was
strong enough to secure a minister to take charge of the work. Isaac
Holman, now a resident of Troy Mills, and a son of Henry Holman, was
the first superintendent of the Sunday school organized in the
township. Rev. N. A. McConnell, of Marion, was one of the ablest
ministers of the early period, and would face the worst storms of the
season in order to keep his appointment. The people living in the
southeastern part of the township at first held services in private
houses until the West Prairie school house was erected, where for
several years they had a place for worship. They now have a splendid
church near the West Prairie school house.

The first justice of the peace of Spring Grove township was John
Plummer, but the best known justices of the peace of the early times
were Elmer Atwood, Josiah Walton, and Wm. Bleakley. While the people of
those days were not free from strife among themselves, yet they were
obliged to band together to free themselves from a worse evil--the
horse thief. The people finally with the help of the neighboring
settlers took the law in their own hands and dealt summary justice to
the offenders. One of these thieves was followed by a posse to his camp
on the Buffalo creek in Buchanan county, and on his refusal to
surrender he was shot to death. This put a stop to the stealing.

In politics the people of Spring Grove always took an active part, and
for a long time claimed to be the banner republican precinct of the
state. During the Civil war the republicans of West Prairie erected a
flag pole on the bare prairie near where now stands the West Prairie
church and raised the Stars and Stripes aloft and kept the flag there
until long after the war closed. At one election during the Civil war
not a democratic vote was cast. It was said that there were a few
democrats in the township but they chose to stay at home rather than
stand the jeers that were sure to assail them if they voted.

Troy Mills, the only village in the township, was founded in 1853, when
a dam was built across the river at that place and a saw mill built.
This mill continued to run about ten years when the present mill was
erected. The mill did a flourishing business grinding all kinds of
grain, but of late years has only been used as a grist mill. Jordon
Long brought the first stock of goods to Troy Mills, amounting to ten
dollars. Meeting with success in selling these, he turned all his
attention to carrying on a general store which he conducted for more
than forty years. Dr. John Dix and E. C. Downs started the first drug
store in the town but soon sold out. E. N. Beach, one of the best known
men in the northern part of Linn county, came to Troy Mills at an early
day and started a drug store and has conducted the same to the present
time. Dr. E. Wilson was the only doctor in our township for several
years and enjoyed a lucrative practice. The first blacksmith shop was
started by Elmer and John E. Atwood in 1854, who conducted the same for
nearly thirty years.

Only a few of the old settlers remain who helped to transform the wilds
into what it is today. Those now living here, who came in the early
'50s, are David Reece, Isaac Holman, John E. Attwood, Mrs. Edwin
Jeffries, Isaac Bice, Enos and Charles Cook. The others have either
moved away or passed into that great beyond from which no traveler
returns.


WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP

Washington township was early settled, for it is stated on good
authority that Bartimus McGonigle settled near what later became Center
Point in 1839. Some of the early settlers were Dr. S. M. Brice, John
Osborn, Tom Lockhart, W. A. Thomas, James Down, Sam Stewart, E. B.
Spencer, Alex Nevin, D. S. Way, Milt Squires, Will Cress, Jacob Thomas,
Robert Osborn, Jonathan Dennison, Alex Thomas, Jas. Chambers. These
came as early as 1842, a number coming in in 1839 and 1840. The
following came before 1846: Thos. Fee, Isaac Berry, J. L. Benham, Levi
Martin, L. Hollenbeck.

The town was laid out in 1848 by Andrew Bottorf. A re-survey was later
made as of 1854, and done by J. McArthur for Dr. S. M. Brice and J. R.
Grubb.

Most of the buildings in the town date from the time of the second
plat, when the place began to thrive in earnest. Dr. Brice ran a store
which was later sold to A. A. Adams. In 1855 Dr. J. P. Wilson opened a
drug store. L. Hollenbeck also opened a general store in 1854. J. M.
Bartleson, W. S. Bliss, and John Carr were also early settlers, Carr
and Bartleson running a store for many years.

The locality in and around Center Point, then, is one of the first
settled in the county. The early settlers were enterprising and the
newcomers were made welcome. No doubt the close proximity to the river
and the abundance of timber in this locality made the place inviting to
the new settlers who needed above everything else timber for use in
building and for fuel. The railroad which the people had expected many
years did not get into town till in 1873, and was continued the
following spring. For the purpose of securing this railroad Washington
township voted $16,000, being about a five per cent tax.

In Washington township lived and died many years ago John Osborn, a
revolutionary soldier, who is buried in Center Point cemetery.




CHAPTER XXXIV

_Lisbon and the United Brethren Church_


In narrating the history of Linn county mention must be made of that
body of devoted men and women who early laid the foundations of the
United Brethren church in this portion of what sixty years ago was the
far west. The members of this christian body have had an important and
conspicuous part in the history of our county. Their leaders have not
only been men of piety, but they have also been men of ability,
builders of commonwealths. Their work has been of a permanent
character, and the descendants of these pioneer people are today doing
grandly the work so nobly begun seventy years ago.

We cannot do better here than to quote largely from the _Historical
Souvenir of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ at Lisbon,
Iowa, 1836-1904_, by Rev. Cyrus J. Kephart, published in 1904 by the
Lisbon _Herald_:


THE BEGINNING OF THE CHURCH IN IOWA

The work of the United Brethren in Christ in Iowa began, as far as
known, with the labors of Rev. Christian Troup, a member of the Wabash
Conference, who came to Iowa as a missionary in 1836,[N] and settled
upon what is now a part of the site of Mount Vernon. He afterwards
traded his 160 acre claim for a yoke of oxen, and settled near the
Cedar river, on what is now known as the Horn farm. Here he passed
through all the privations of a frontier life. His daughter, Mrs. Pate,
states that for a considerable time he and his family ground the corn
for their bread on an old-fashioned coffee mill nailed to the side of a
tree.

Rev. Troup's field as a missionary extended from the city of Dubuque to
Henry county. His preaching places were wherever he could find an
opportunity to speak to the people. Thus he sowed the seed that
afterward ripened into many an active Christian life.

One of his appointments was near Ivanhoe, in a log house of only two
rooms. Here standing in the low doorway he would speak first to those
gathered in one room, then stooping, for he was a tall man, he would
pass his head into the other room and speak to those there.

He died in 1850 and was buried in the cemetery that then occupied the
lot where the house of Mrs. Mary Hoover now stands in Lisbon. When the
cemetery was changed his remains were removed to the present Lisbon
cemetery.

In 1838 Rev. John Burns, a local preacher, settled in Lee county, and
began preaching at various points. Rev. Christian Troup and he seem to
have been the pioneers of the United Brethren in Christ in Iowa.

The first society was organized at the home of "Father" Edington,
probably somewhere in Henry county, in October, 1841. This, however,
was several years after Christian Troup began his work in the community
in which Lisbon now stands.

The first United Brethren quarterly conference west of the Mississippi
was held at the home of Mr. Gibson near the present site of Lisbon, May
10, 1842. It was attended by Christian Troup, F. R. S. Byrd, Ira B.
Ryan, Lewis Hoffman, "Father" Edington, and others. Ira B. Ryan was
licensed to preach, and Christian Troup was chosen presiding elder.

Another similar meeting was held in Henry county on September 10th of
the same year. Considerable annual conference business was transacted
at this meeting.

A third meeting of the same character was held, probably in the
southern part of the state in March, 1843, there being present a
presiding elder of the Wabash Conference, of the territory of which
Iowa at that time was a part. At this meeting there were reported
thirteen organized societies, with one hundred and ninety-four members
in Iowa.

The first annual conference of the United Brethren in Iowa, and the
first west of the Mississippi, convened at Columbus City, May 19, 1844,
Bishop Henry Kumler, Jr., presiding. It was called the Iowa Branch of
the Wabash Conference.

The next annual conference convened at the home of Wm. Thompson, in
Louisa county, August 14, 1845, Bishop John Russell, presiding. At this
session the Iowa conference was formally organized.

Other early conferences were held as follows:

At Columbus City, August 31, 1846, Bishop J. J. Glossbrenner,
presiding.

At the home of Wm. Thompson, Louisa county, August 24, 1847, Bishop Wm.
Hanby, presiding.

At the home of John Shively, Henry county, September 1, 1848, Bishop
Wm. Hanby, presiding.

At the Hershey school house near Lisbon, August 23, 1849, Bishop David
Edwards, presiding.

During these years the preachers in charge of the territory including
Lisbon were:

     1843-44 John Peters.
     1844-45 Christian Troup.
     1845-47 J. W. Sterling.
     1847-48 Luther McVay.
     1848-49 Luther McVay, with John DeMoss, assistant.

Writing of the Iowa conference of 1845, Bishop Russell said: "Myself
and wife left the state of Maryland in a carriage for Iowa. A tedious
journey indeed. All went well until we got between the two
rivers--Mississippi and Iowa. In the high prairie grass our trail ran
out, and of course we were lost. How to get on the right course was the
trouble.

"I went before, parting the grass, which was much higher than myself.
After I had gone a certain distance, I put my hat on my cane to guide
my wife to the spot. Thus I continued for some time till we got right
again."


THE UNITED BRETHREN AT LISBON

Our life and work at Lisbon date back to the faithful labors of Rev.
Christian Troup, who began preaching in this vicinity as early as 1836.
Hence the church at Lisbon had its beginning with the very beginning of
our church in Iowa.

The work here grew slowly, however, for several years, Bro. Troup often
advising his converts to join other churches on account of the weakness
of the United Brethren in Iowa.

In 1847 Rev. Christian Hershey led quite a large colony, chiefly his
own relatives, from Pennsylvania to Iowa, and settled in Yankee Grove,
the section of country surrounding where Lisbon now stands.

This colony, being largely composed of United Brethren, made quite an
addition to the United Brethren forces of this vicinity.

In August of the same year Rev. Luther McVay was appointed to the
Yankee Grove circuit. During the summer of 1848 he held a camp-meeting
on the knoll now occupied by the Washington school building of Lisbon,
with good results. He then organized "the United Brethren class in the
Pennsylvania Settlement of Linn county, Iowa," with a charter
membership of about forty, as nearly as can be determined from the
original class book. About twelve names were afterward added, the year
closing with a membership of 52. The effecting of an organization was
strongly opposed by many of the older persons who took an active part
in the camp-meeting; not because of opposition to the church, but
feeling that it was not right to formally organize and put the names on
a class book.

Of these charter members, two are yet members of the church, Mr.
Michael Blessing, and Mrs. Nancy Neidig.

On August 23, 1849, the Iowa annual conference was held here. Lisbon
had just been platted, and homes were scarce. To meet the difficulty
occasioned by the coming of so many ministers, a camp-meeting was
planned; tents were built on the camp ground, and the conference was
held in connection with the camp-meeting. There were a number of
conversions, and at the close of the camp-meeting twenty-five persons
were baptized in the Cedar river near Ivanhoe, by Rev. Josiah Lindsey.

Rev. Christian Hershey and Rev. D. Wenrich were received into the
conference at this session upon their transfers. Rev. John De Moss,
assistant pastor of Yankee Grove circuit, reported $26.55 received as
salary and presents for the year.

The Lisbon class proper, at first called North Yankee Grove class, was
organized September 5, 1850, by Rev. S. W. Kern, pastor. The original
record shows 36 members of this class, many of whom belonged to the
"United Brethren Class in the Pennsylvania Settlement in Linn county,
Iowa," and several were new members. That there existed some difficulty
in connection with the work at this place at that time is manifest from
the following from Rev. D. Wenrich in an article in the _Telescope_
relative to the conference session of 1850: "On account of a peculiar
state of things on Yankee Grove circuit it was asked that a good
disciplinarian be appointed to the charge. The selection of Rev. S. W.
Kern and the adjustment of the difficulty proved the wisdom of the
choice." Just what the difficulty was, whether it was among members of
the church of a personal character, or whether it was something in
connection with the administration of the affairs of the church, there
is no record to show.

The annual conference of 1852 chose Lisbon as the place of meeting for
the next annual session. Rev. Christian Hershey, who had been in an
important sense the father of the Lisbon church, looked forward to its
coming with great expectations. When the time arrived for making
necessary local preparation, he joined most heartily in the work. After
cleaning the church and putting everything in readiness, he proposed to
a friend who was with him to go into the church and offer prayer for
the conference. He was in great joy. But on August 3d, the day before
the assembling of conference, very suddenly the death angel called, and
Father Hershey passed away. His death cast a gloom over the entire
session. Rev. George Miller was chosen to preach the funeral sermon.
The conference in a body marched before his corpse to the church and to
the grave. His remains were buried in the cemetery beside the church
and afterwards were removed to the present Lisbon cemetery, where they
now rest.

The growth of the church following the year 1849 was quite rapid. But
it is impossible to determine what the total membership has been, on
account of the mutilation of the early records. So far as we can learn
the number of persons received between 1840 and 1870 was fully five
hundred. Since 1870 the accessions have been quite numerous. A number
of very successful revivals have been held. From 1870 to the present
time, as nearly as can be determined, the number of accessions has
been about 790, thus showing a membership of nearly 1,300 since the
organization of the church in 1849.

The Lisbon charge has been favored with a number of most excellent
pastors. So far as the records show, the largest increase of membership
was during the pastorate of Rev. William Cunningham. During his service
of eighteen months there were eighty-four additions to the church.

Among those who have assisted largely to the development and growth of
the church, the following seem to deserve special mention: Christian
Hershey, Michael Hoover, Sr., D. Runkle, John Neidig, Jacob Kettering,
A. A. Sweet, Samuel Long, John Eby, Lawrence Easterly, J. E. Kurtz, D.
Dorwart, Henry Meyers, John Ringer, Sr., Elias Hahn, D. Buck, John
Turner, George Graul, D. G. Zeigenfus, Thomas Runkle, C. H. Neidig,
Abram Runkle, Adam Runkle, Amos Runkle, W. S. Furnas, Elizabeth Perry,
Nancy Neidig, Sr., Mother Bressler, Anna Bitzer and Elizabeth N.
Runkle. The list could be greatly enlarged with perfect truthfulness.
But these are among the number who seem to have stood out with special
prominence in the work of the church.

We would make special mention of Rev. S. E. Long, Rev. A. B. Statton,
and Rev. M. S. Runkle, who were raised as members of our church and
have gone into the ministry of the gospel.

Also Mrs. G. K. Little, daughter of Bro. J. Bittinger, whose sweet
voice and loving life are living epistles for Christ, greatly assisting
in the evangelistic work of her husband, Rev. G. K. Little, who for
years was a faithful member here.

Rev. I. L. Buchwalter and his devoted wife, who have made Lisbon their
home since he retired from the active ministry, have been active and
liberal in their devotion to the interests and work of the church.


CHURCH BUILDINGS

In 1850 Rev. Christian Hershey built in Lisbon, chiefly at his own
expense, the First United Brethren church west of the Mississippi
river. This church, which still stands just north of Mrs. Mary Hoover's
residence, was soon outgrown. In 1855 it was sold, and the proceeds
were used in building the second church on the site occupied by the
present edifice. This building served the church for twenty-six years.

During the pastorate of Rev. T. D. Adams and the early part of the
first pastorate of Rev. I. K. Statton, the need of a more modern church
became apparent. At the session of the quarterly conference on April 7,
1880, the first official steps were taken toward the erection of a new
building. During the following summer the old church was torn down, and
the present structure begun. It was completed at a cost of $9,200.00,
and on January 23, 1881, was dedicated by Bishop Milton Wright. Great
credit is due to the ever earnest and faithful labors of the pastor,
Dr. I. K. Statton.

During the building of the new church, the congregation was favored in
being granted the use of the Methodist Episcopal church for all its
services.


PARSONAGES

The church during its history has owned three parsonages. The present
building is an elegant frame structure of eight rooms, furnished with
furnace, electric light, and city water. It was purchased during the
summer of 1903 for $2,400, the old one being sold for $1,000.


THE SUNDAY SCHOOL

The Sunday school was organized early in the history of the Lisbon
church, probably in the spring of 1853. It was first conducted as a
union school, and so continued for a number of years, its development
into a United Brethren school being the result chiefly of the
organization of other schools in town.

At the first it was divided into male and female departments, with five
male and seven female classes; among them were one female and two male
spelling classes, and one female infant class. Among the first scholars
were Henry C. Kurtz, and Solomon Kettering, who are yet living. The
record of 1854 shows three infant classes, one male and two female. In
the male class were two of our present members, Henry C. Meyers, and
Jacob E. Meyers, with their father Henry Meyers as teacher.

The first secretary's record that is preserved begins with July, 1857.
The enrollment was 121, the attendance 118. The superintendent was A.
A. Sweet. May 27, 1860, is named as "the first day of the
administration of B. [Benjamin] Hoover as superintendent, to which
office he was elected last night." Other evidence states that Adam
Runkle had served as superintendent, one year before this election.
Following this the record shows nothing as to who was superintendent
till April 2, 1865, when it states, "Had our annual election last
evening for officers. Adam Runkle was re-elected superintendent, D.
Dorwart, secretary, D. Buck, librarian." I. Scoles is the first
secretary named, his election occurring May 2, 1858. The next named
following him is J. E. Kurtz, who served a number of years, his term of
office terminating with the election of D. Dorwart as above noted.

The enrollment did not increase rapidly, owing in part no doubt to the
organizing of other schools. On January 1, 1860, it was 144; on January
6, 1861, 145, with 140 in attendance.

The record from 1857 to 1865 is rendered quite interesting by the
recital of current events of the town and community. A few are here
quoted:

     July 26, 1857. "A stranger bathing last Sabbath in the Cedar
     river was drowned. Remember to keep the Sabbath day holy."

     December 15, 1857. "Officers and teachers agreed to have a
     teachers' meeting monthly."

     April 11, 1859. "The Lutheran church organized a Sunday
     school in the old church today."

     July 9, 1859. "The school was opened at eight o'clock on
     account of the Methodist quarterly meeting in this house at
     nine o'clock."

     November 6, 1859. "Small attendance on account of wedding in
     town, Mr. Joel Ringer and Miss Barbara Kurtz."

     July 29, 1860. "Bishop Glossbrenner was here yesterday, and
     went to Western."

     September 9, 1860. "We hear for the first time two bells
     ringing in town."

     October 28, 1860. "Mrs. Easterly married to David Zeigenfus."

     November 11, 1860. "Old Abe elected."

     September 21, 1861. "Yesterday great military demonstration;
     young men leaving for the army."

     November 1, 1863. "Yesterday all the liquor destroyed by the
     sheriff."

     November 29, 1863. "No school in consequence of the
     Evangelical dedication."

     January 16, 1865. "Large school, as both schools are united."
     "Both schools" seems to refer to our own and a Sunday school
     conducted for a short time by the Presbyterians. Enrollment
     129; attendance 166.

     April 16, 1865. "Our church was draped in memory of the death
     of our late President, Abraham Lincoln."

     May 7, 1865. "The Missionary Board met with us. Bishops
     Edwards, Markwood, and Kumler, and Revs. S. VonNeida and J.
     W. Shuey were present."

Reference is frequently made to deaths that occurred in town. The
burial of several soldiers is noted. The secretaries of later years
recorded but little of such general events. The record of June 6,
1880, says: "On account of tearing down the church, school met in M. E.
church at 2:00 p. m." On May 26, 1878, I. K. Statton, Mrs. T. D. Adams,
J. Bittinger, Amos Runkle and wife and Miss Sue Fletcher were appointed
delegates to the township and the county conventions.

The superintendents have been A. A. Sweet, Benjamin Hoover, Adam
Runkle, J. Bittinger, W. H. Runkle, J. S. Smith, U. D. Runkle, and the
present incumbent, Amos K. Runkle, who has served the school
continuously for sixteen years, and has just been reelected.

The Woman's Missionary Association of the United Brethren church of
Lisbon, was organized October 27, 1878, with the direction and
assistance of Mrs. A. L. Billheimer. Mrs. T. D. Adams was appointed
temporary secretary. The following officers were elected: Mrs. Mary
Shaler, president; Mrs. A. K. Runkle, vice president; Mrs. Addie Eby,
secretary; Mrs. Lizzie A. Runkle, treasurer; solicitors: Mrs. E. N.
Runkle, Mrs. Holderman, Mrs. Nancy Neidig, Miss Maggie Houser, Mrs.
Katie Kurtz.

The first regular meeting was held at the parsonage and was opened by
devotional exercises by Mrs. Charlotte Davis (wife of Rev. Wm. Davis).


LISBON CAMP-MEETING

The earliest camp-meeting of our church in this vicinity, as far as can
be learned, was held in 1848 on the site of the present school
building. It was followed by the second in 1849, and a third in 1852.
Similar meetings were held at various times and places for several
years.

At a quarterly conference held July 7, 1879, a camp-meeting committee
was appointed, consisting of Rev. T. D. Adams, and brothers J.
Bittinger, D. Runkle, C. H. Neidig, A. E. Kurtz, A. K. Runkle, George
Rupert, Sr., and J. S. Smith. The committee organized on July 11,
electing Rev. T. D. Adams, president, and Rev. I. K. Statton,
secretary. A plot of ground of about twenty-five acres, lying one and
one-fourth miles southeast of Lisbon was purchased, and a camp-meeting
planned to begin on August 26 following. At this time the temporary
organization was succeeded by a permanent one, with Rev. T. D. Adams,
president, and J. Bittinger, secretary. On September 3d, the grounds
were dedicated by Bishop Milton Wright, Rev. T. D. Adams, Pastor, Rev.
I. K. Statton, presiding elder, and a number of other ministers
assisting.

The ground was a nicely wooded tract, with two good springs, and was
fitted up with a number of neat cottages, a boarding house, chapel,
speakers' stand, and seats, and was enclosed with a substantial fence.
Among the prominent men who at different times took part in the
meetings were, Bishops Weaver, Kephart, Hott, Mills, and Wright,
President W. M. Beardshear, and Dr. J. W. Etter. Interesting meetings
were held each summer up to and including 1893. Some hindrance at
length arose, and at the annual meeting held on August 27, 1894, the
association voted to sell the grounds and disorganize.

CHAPTER XXXV

_County and District Politics_


It has been stated that the first election in the county was held at
Westport in 1838 when thirty-two votes were cast in the county. This is
said to have been the most quiet election on record. Gradually the
people located claims, as more lands were thrown open to settlement,
and politics began to cut a figure at an early date. While many of the
settlers came from the south, a majority, however, came from Ohio, from
the middle states, and from New England. Thus it would appear that the
population of Iowa was a part of the free state movement which had
peopled the central states. The foreign population did not come to Iowa
until the early '50s, when the Germans, Scandinavians, Scotch, and
Irish came in large numbers to take up the cheap lands which were
offered to the settlers.

The early settlers were for the most part democrats, with a sprinkling
of whigs and abolitionists. Some of these voted for Taylor for
president in 1844, nearly all of whom supported Fremont later.

Thus in Brown township Ed Crow, Horace Brown, and the Butlers were
democrats, while the Plummers, Yocums, Hamptons, Stanleys, and Dewees
families were originally whigs, who joined the republican party in
1856. In Franklin township the members of the United Brethren church in
and around Lisbon, and the Methodists around Mount Vernon were stanch
abolitionists, joining the republican party when that was formed.
Around Bertram a large number affiliated with the democratic party,
which was true of the settlers in and around Center Point. In the
northern part of the county, James Nugent, A. C. Coquillette, Joe
Whitney, Peter Henderson, and many others were republicans, or joined
the party later. In Maine township the Jordan families were divided in
politics, some belonging to one party, others to another. These men
were a sturdy lot of pioneers and did much in a political and financial
way to build up the county.

In Rapids township and Cedar Rapids, many of the old settlers were
democrats, such as N. B. Brown, D. M. McIntosh, the Bryan boys, E. R.
Derby, William Harper, the Weares, J. J. Snouffer, Hart brothers, and
many others. Judge Greene was one of the most prominent democrats who
joined the republican ranks in the Greeley campaign. The Weares joined
the republican party during the Civil war period. Some of the prominent
republicans of an early day were E. N. Bates, the Carrolls, Elys,
Leaches, Higleys, J. S. and T. Z. Cook, Isaac Cook, Dr. S. D.
Carpenter, Dr. E. L. Mansfield, Gabriel Carpenter.

In Marion township, which was then and for many years afterwards the
political center of the county, the whigs, who later became
republicans, were such men as N. M. Hubbard, R. D. Stephens, Joseph
Young, William Cook, William G. Thompson, James E. Bromwell, William
Smythe, Robert Smythe, Robert Holmes, the Herveys, and the Daniels
family.

Among the democrats were such prominent men as Colonel I. M. Preston,
S. H. Tryon, S. W. Durham, H. W. Gray, Dr. T. S. Bardwell, T. J.
McKean, J. C. Barry, James Green, L. M. Strong, C. T. Williams, and
James Brown.

During the territorial days Robert Lucas was a democrat, while John
Chambers was a whig, succeeded by James Clarke, another democrat.
During these early territorial days Linn county cut very little figure
in the affairs of the newly organized territory, as the river counties
had most of the settlers and otherwise controlled political affairs in
general. In the first assembly which met at Burlington, November 11,
1838, this county was represented by Charles Whittelsy in the council,
and by Robert G. Roberts in the house. The district then was composed
of Cedar, Johnson, Jones, and Linn counties.

The second assembly met at the same place November 4, 1839, this
district being represented in the council by Charles Whittelsy, and by
George H. Walworth in the house. The district this year was composed of
Cedar, Jones, and Linn counties.

The third assembly convened at Burlington November 2, 1840, and now,
for the first time, Linn county was represented in the council by a
resident of the county, in the person of George Greene. In the house
sat George H. Walworth and H. Van Antwerp.

The fourth assembly convened at the newly selected capital at Iowa
City, and in the council or upper house sat again George Greene, and in
the house were Thomas Higginson and Thomas Denson.

In the fifth assembly sat J. P. Cook in the council and George H.
Walworth and J. C. Barry in the house, the latter being a resident of
Linn county.

In the sixth assembly sat J. P. Cook in the council, George H. Walworth
and Robert Smythe in the house, Smythe being a resident of the county.
For many years he was a prominent politician in Iowa, and sat in the
lower and upper houses for many years.

In the seventh assembly, which convened at Iowa City in May, 1845, sat
William Abbe in the council, and Joe K. Snyder and John Taylor in the
house. William Abbe was the first actual settler in the county and one
of the best known persons in eastern Iowa in early days. Mr. Abbe also
sat in the assembly which met at Iowa City in December, 1845.

Linn county was also represented by able men in the constitutional
conventions, and no doubt the members from this county did much in the
adoption of our constitution. In the first constitutional convention
which convened October 7, 1844, there sat as members from this county
the following persons: T. J. McKean, L. M. Strong, and S. W. Durham,
all democrats. This convention numbered fifty-three democrats and
seventeen whigs. In the second constitutional convention, which met at
the seat of government May 4, 1856, Linn and Benton counties were
represented by Socrates H. Tryon, of Marion. In this convention, which
was smaller than the first, the party vote stood twenty democrats and
ten whigs.

In the third constitutional convention, which met January 19, 1857,
there sat H. W. Gray, of Marion, as a member of the convention, and
Ellsworth N. Bates, of Cedar Rapids, as assistant secretary, a young
man of brilliant parts.

The first governor of the newly made state, Ansel Briggs, was a
democrat, as was Stephen Hempstead, his successor. James W. Grimes, who
had located at Burlington in 1836, was nominated for the office of
governor at the whig convention in 1854, and made a memorable canvass.
His well known anti-slavery views rendered him acceptable to all who
were opposed to the extension of that institution. While many
conservative whigs agreed with the democrats on the slavery issue,
still all classes who favored free soil united in the support of
Grimes, who was favorably known and had been a member of the
legislature, and who had made a favorable impression upon the new
settlers who had come into the state to find homes. Grimes was elected,
and this was the first defeat of the democrats since Iowa was organized
as a territory.

In January, 1856, Governor Grimes wrote the call for the convention,
which met at Iowa City on February 22d, which founded the republican
party. In this convention there sat a number of Linn county persons who
later became noted men in the party, and well known in the state.

The first presidential vote in Iowa was in the election in 1848, when
Cass, the regular democratic nominee, received 12,083 votes, Taylor,
whig, 11,084 votes, and Martin Van Buren, free soil democrat, 1,126
votes. In the election of 1852, which was quite exciting all over the
country, and not least in Iowa, the popular votes for president were as
follows: Franklin Pierce, democrat, 17,763, Winfield Scott, whig,
15,856, John P. Hale, free democracy, 1,704 votes. This vote would
indicate that the democratic party still held the balance of power in
the state, but the change in old party lines was apparent.

During the years up to 1856, a large number of pioneers had come into
the state from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Michigan, as well as
from the New England states, and bitter party feeling ran high. Many of
the party leaders took the stump, and speeches were made in nearly all
these settlements. Newspapers were established and an active campaign
brought about. Politics was the topic of conversation at the country
store, at the grist-mill, and at the country postoffices, and everyone
felt that a change along party lines would be apparent. The vote in
Iowa for president in 1856 was: John C. Fremont, republican, 43,954,
James Buchanan, democrat, 36,170, Millard Fillmore, American party,
9,180. James W. Grimes, the candidate for governor on the Fremont
ticket, was re-elected.

In this campaign the question of slavery was the main issue, and on
this ground the newly organized republican party carried the day in
Iowa. Iowa from this time was lost to the democrats, and they were
unable to regain the lost ground by attempting to get away from the
slavery issue. During the summer and fall of 1860 the campaign
surpassed even the excitable campaign of four years previous. At the
fall election Lincoln received 70,409 votes, S. A. Douglas, democrat,
55,111 votes, John Bell, 17,763 votes. J. C. Breckenridge, the regular
democratic nominee, who aimed to carry slavery into the territory at
any cost, received in this state only 1,048. The Douglas wing of the
party "aimed to throw the responsibility of the slavery question upon
the supreme court or upon the territories, or anywhere else, except
upon the democratic party." Douglas had many admirers in this county,
and he visited, in this campaign, Marion and Cedar Rapids, where people
flocked to hear him, many of whom admired him, but there were few who
could support his visionary schemes and many who doubted the outcome of
his dubious platform. This year the republican state ticket received on
an average a plurality of 13,670 votes. In this election the state had
become one of the solid republican states, and has so continued. In the
state campaign of 1861 S. J. Kirkwood carried the state in an exciting
campaign over William H. Merritt, the regular democratic nominee. Mr.
Merritt had become a resident of this county, and hence received a
large vote in his old home. Kirkwood had won over A. C. Dodge by a
majority of 3,000 two years before, and was a popular candidate, a man
of many strong traits of character. The Civil war was on and the people
felt that they must sustain the policies of the party in power, and
hence, perhaps, the popularity of the prospective candidates cut but
little figure.

During one of these campaigns as Perry Oxley and Ambrose Harlan were
seated discussing politics at the county seat one day, Harlan in his
wrath accused Oxley of being a traitor to the government. This was too
much for the irate Kentucky-born democrat, and he knocked Harlan down
with a savage blow aimed at the fellow's head. There was a trial for
assault and battery, to which Oxley pleaded guilty, and later Harlan
brought an action for damages in the district court, which damages were
paid pro-rata by the democrats over the county. Col. I. M. Preston
defended Oxley and the outcome of the verdict in fact made the issues
for the next campaign.

At commencement exercises at Mt. Vernon a general free-for-all fight
occurred on account of some girls wearing copperhead pins. This matter
also came into the courts, and county politics at least changed
conditions, as party feelings ran high, and perhaps the ultimate
motives of party politics were lost sight of, in these hand to hand
contests waged near at home.

During the early days Joel Leverich was a prominent political character
in Linn county. He was called the "Bogus Coon," as it was claimed that
he belonged to a gang of counterfeiters. However true that may he, no
one knows, as he called himself a fellow who could make counterfeit
money which would pass muster even in the land office. Leverich was a
bright and intelligent person and wielded a great deal of influence as
a sort of ward heeler before wards were organized in an early day, and
it was frequently stated "that as Joel Leverich went, so went the
county." Joel was not perhaps as interested in the political views of
the candidates as he was in getting pay for his services and in having
a promise of a pull with the officers if elected.

Bill Brody also wielded more or less influence in an early day in the
county, and sometimes lined up with one party and sometimes with
another. It was generally true, that if Leverich and his followers were
all on one side, Brody and his companions would generally be opposed,
and it was very seldom that both gangs were enlisted to work for the
same political party in any one campaign.

At one time just preceding a county election, members of the two gangs
met at the Joshua Glover saloon in Marion. All had been drinking, and
it was not long until the street was full of people, there being
fifteen to twenty on a side all engaged in a general free-for-all
fight. No one tried to interfere, and blood flowed freely. While Bill
Brody was the leader and perhaps the most active, his chum and
follower, Barry Way, was the most powerful fighter, and is said to have
cleaned out the entire gang and won the day. His political party was in
power for a day at least.

While there was much disorder, and trouble arose on account of lack of
enforcement of law and order, it would be apparent that if men were
elected to office by the assistance and help of men of this type it was
not surprising to hear that officials could not, or would not always
carry out the provisions of the law. Ambrose Harlan, well known in an
early day as a person who had nerve and considerable fight in him, came
out as a candidate for sheriff on a platform all his own, claiming that
"he would catch horse thieves, and would even serve a warrant on Bill
Brody himself, leader of the notorious gang," referred to in these
pages.

Harlan became an imaginary hero in the eyes of the people, and was
elected by a large majority. For a long time after he had assumed the
duties of his office there did not seem to be anything doing in his
particular line. In fact the sheriff's office was the most deserted
place at the county seat. It resembled a summer resort in winter time,
and Harlan was about to resign for want of anything to do, for if there
was anything Harlan loved it was a fight to a finish or a wordy contest
with a political opponent. As sheriff there was nothing to do in either
line, for people seemed for once to mind their own business.

At last, one morning a warrant was brought to the sheriff to be served
on Brody, who had been charged with grand larceny of a team of horses.
Harlan's moment had come, and he prided himself on the fact that he
would lodge Brody in jail before the next sun set. A few inquiries were
made, and Brody was located in the Way cabin, some five or six miles
east of Vinton. At Vinton Harlan organized a posse and started early
next morning to catch the culprit before he would leave for the day.

They surrounded the cabin, Harlan fearing that the fellows had already
escaped, but he ascertained that the smoke issuing from the cabin was
only an indication that Mrs. Way was getting breakfast ready. He found
Bill Brody and his chum Barry Way in bed. He was not long in making his
errand known, and Brody replied. "Do you want me naked or will you give
me time to put on my duds?" To which Harlan replied that as it was
still early and he had all day, he would wait till the fellows dressed.
The men took considerable time in arranging their morning toilet,
saying to one another that it might be a long time before they would
get back, and that the trial court could do nothing without their
presence, so there was no hurry. Harlan sat on a home-made rickety
chair in one corner of the room, with a gun in his left hand and a
hickory stick in the other, watching the two culprits, and recalling
the old refrain, "Weep no mo' me lady," as he watched the poor mother
Way walking about the room with tears in her eyes, wondering what her
wayward son had been up to this time. Harlan kept special watch on Way,
who was the athlete, not fearing Brody, who was a small person. As
Harlan looked out at the tiny window to detect a certain noise he
heard, Brody, nimble as a cat, was at his side in an instant. He wrung
the hickory sapling out of the sheriff's hands and struck him a savage
blow on the head so that the Linn county official was "dead to the
world" for at least thirty minutes. The crowd outside were in hiding
near a straw stack, and when they saw the two desperadoes come out of
the cabin alone without any sheriff following, they took to their
horses and rode away as fast as they could, never looking around till
the town of Vinton was in sight.

When the sheriff realized what had happened, he was invited to
breakfast by Mrs. Way, who said it might be a long time before her
boarders would return. The sheriff would not accept the invitation, but
asked instead for bandages for his head.

Harlan was asked on his return to the county seat, minus his prisoner,
"Why didn't you take Bill when you had him?" Harlan replied, "How could
I, when I had a gun in one hand and a hickory stick in the other, which
he took away and rapped me over the head with, and when I came to my
senses he wasn't there."

It was needless to say, that at the next election no one cared to enter
the race on a strictly horse thief catching platform.

One of the most remarkable political contests ever waged in the county
was that of N. M. Hubbard and William Smythe for congress in 1868.
Hubbard had been a sort of political dictator since the organization of
the republican party. He had held the office of county judge for a
short time, and had been appointed attorney for the Northwestern
railway, and for this reason was a powerful factor in financial as well
as in political circles. Hubbard was quarrelsome, impertinent, and
out-spoken, and used to say, that he "loved a nigger more than he did a
democrat." In his aspirations for office he was backed by many friends
and admirers, such as the Weares, Elys, Carrolls, and Higleys in Cedar
Rapids, and by most of the prominent Marion men, such as the Herveys,
the Daniels families, Captain Rathbun, Major Thompson, and Bob Holmes.

The people of Marion were bitter against Hubbard, especially R. D.
Stephens, who had been Hubbard's partner for some time, which
partnership ended in a row, the last formal dissolution of the
partnership being to the effect that Hubbard said to Stephens that "he
would not attend his funeral," to which the partner replied, "neither
will I attend yours or ever darken your threshhold in any capacity."

Stephens by this time was a financial factor in the county and had many
friends. It was thought that he should make the run against Hubbard,
who had removed to Cedar Rapids, but the leaders of this faction of the
party thought that a candidate must be selected who had been in the
war, and thus the opponents of Hubbard selected William Smythe, who was
a brother-in-law of Stephens, as the logical candidate to make the
race. Smythe was an Irishman who had been an officer in the Civil war;
was an eminent lawyer, a most affable gentleman, who had made a
reputation for himself as a conservative and safe political leader.

In this canvass Smythe was also backed by Robert Smythe, an older
brother, who had been in the legislature, and was favorably known
throughout the county. Stephens was the financial backer and the
organizer of the Smythe faction. He was far-sighted, wielded
considerable political and social influence, and used his money freely
in this campaign to get even with Hubbard, if for no other reason. In
this fight Stephens enlisted the service of a number of prominent
democrats who were unfriendly to Hubbard. Everyone expected that
Hubbard would win hands down, and carry Cedar Rapids and many of the
county precincts. Smythe enlisted in his cause such men as Colonel
Preston, Dr. Thos. Bardwell, J. H. Preston, S. W. Durham, James Brown,
and many other democrats who were on the inside of this movement to
dethrone the republican county boss. Smythe carried Marion township
much to the surprise of the local leaders who had thought up to that
time that everything was cocked and primed for Hubbard.

The county went about half and half; both parties, of course, had
expected a small majority. When the officers were selected and a
contest came up to a show of hands, the convention stood a tie. The old
court house was filled to overflowing, and many wordy contests took
place outside as well as inside of the old dingy court room.

The afternoon passed and neither side got ahead. Stephens was the
active leader on the floor of the convention and knew more about
parliamentary rules than anyone else. Still there were others in the
convention on the Hubbard side who were no novices at the business of
packing a convention.

An agreement had been made that the winner should select his own
delegates, and it was conceded that whoever carried the county would
carry the district. Neither faction dared to adjourn, and so the fight
was kept up on motions of one kind and another with voting now and then
to ascertain if the members had changed. They all "stood pat," and it
has since been suggested that this must have been the first time the
word standpatter was used in a political sense.

In the evening Dr. Thomas S. Bardwell moved about in the convention
hall shaking hands with his professional brethren and others. He
invited a stanch supporter of Hubbard from up the county, and a
professional brother, into his postoffice and into a back room where he
lived. They got into conversation and Bardwell knew that the man wanted
a little for his stomach's sake, for he had traveled a long ways that
morning and had had nothing to eat all day. Bardwell fully agreed with
the country doctor that the air of a dingy court room was bad for the
lungs, and that a life of that kind would certainly ruin the health of
any man, however strong he might otherwise he. The country doctor took
one and then another drink from the city man's private supply, and the
Marion man was not one of the kind that refused even to take a drink
with his country friend. The conversation moved much easier and more
pleasant after the first few drinks, and Bardwell, to show that he was
a good fellow, brought out a variety of liquor, such as would have made
the mouth of a true Kentuckian smack in anticipation. It was not long
till the country practitioner forgot all about the convention and was
"dead to the world." He was placed in the doctor's bed, the doors
locked, and Bardwell hurried back to the court house, sending a note to
Stephens to the effect that he must put the vote at once. Stephens did
not know whether Bardwell was putting up a scheme on him or not, but he
was about at the end with his objections and thought he would try just
another vote and risk everything on a democrat's advice. Stephens
withdrew his motion then pending and called for a vote by ballot. The
Hubbard faction was glad of this opportunity, and as there were no
objections the seesaw affair of balloting once more began.

When the votes were counted it was found that the Hubbard faction was
one short. They counted and re-counted, and made the air blue with dire
threats, wondering who had sold out, but no "Judas" could be found.
Finally it was discovered that the country delegate aforesaid was
missing. It was thought that he had gone home or had been called away
on professional business, but such was not the case. The aforesaid
country delegate was not made aware of the real condition of things
till the next morning when he awoke in the back room of the doctor's
office wondering how he had gotten such fine quarters without any
assistance from either side, as far as he knew.

The convention went wild over Smythe's victory and the city of Marion,
regardless of party, was caught in this wave of enthusiasm, and the
only topic of conversation for a long time afterwards was "how William
Smythe won the fight."

The newspaper which gave the best write-up of this political contest,
and the paper which did more for Smythe than any other political organ
in the county, was the _Linn County Signal_, edited by a nephew of S.
W. Durham, by the name of Williams. The editorial writers, however,
were such men as Dr. Thos. Bardwell, James Brown, S. W. Durham, Colonel
I. M. Preston, and Judge J. H. Preston, who was just then beginning to
learn the inside workings of politics. A tramp printer by the name of
Tompkins came along some time before the convention occurred, out of
money and out of work, and was employed on the paper. Tompkins looked
and acted like a fool, but was in fact a genius. He could write better
than the best of them, and knew shorthand as well. He reported the
proceedings of this unique convention, and it is stated by all,
regardless of party affiliations, that this write-up was the best of
any political write-up of any convention before or since.

After Smythe had been duly nominated for congress, the democrats of
Linn county refused to support the republican candidate any longer, as
they were only acting in the capacity of beating Hubbard. William E.
Leffingwell, of Clinton, one of the silver-tongued orators of the west
and an eminent man in many ways, was selected as the standard bearer of
the democratic party to oppose Smythe. As Hubbard and his friends
knifed Smythe on account of the action taken by Smythe's followers in
the county convention, there was hope that a democrat might be elected.
The county democrats challenged Smythe to a joint debate, hoping that
he would refuse to debate with a person much his superior. But Smythe
accepted the challenge and it was decided that there should be three
joint debates in the county, at Center Point, Marion, and Cedar Rapids.
The first joint debate was to be held at Center Point--a democratic
stronghold--and Smythe and his followers drove over from Marion in
large numbers, for they wanted to protect their candidate in case any
trouble should arise. Leffingwell and his party also started from
Marion, made up of the most influential democrats in Cedar Rapids and
Marion. Dr. Bardwell, one of the leaders of the democracy, and who had
laid out the Hubbard supporter at the time of the convention, sat in
the back seat of the buggy with Leffingwell and carried the same kind
of wet goods along on this evening and for the same purpose that the
candidate should take something for his stomach's sake. This time
Bardwell was in earnest and really wanted to instill into the candidate
a little of the spirit which would brace him up to a greater effort. He
did not figure that Leffingwell's only fault was his love for the
bottle. When they arrived at Center Point more liquor was added, and
when Leffingwell sat in the stuffy room listening to Smythe's opening
arguments half an hour, the liquor took effect, and he became so drunk
that he could hardly stand up, and made a rambling sort of a speech as
only one under the influence of liquor could make. Smythe replied to
the rambling remarks of his opponent in a most masterly way and in such
a telling manner that even the democrats got disgusted with their own
candidate, and the Marion contingent felt that hanging would have been
too good for Doc Bardwell.

This first meeting ended the joint debates with Leffingwell. Later in
the fall the democrats secured another debater from southern Iowa in
the person of Martin Van Buren Bennett, a rabid partisan and a fiery
orator, who, perhaps, surpassed Smythe in oratory, but who failed to
make any special gains for his party as he was an outsider who dwelt on
past history and did not confine himself to present conditions.

[Illustration: BIRDSEYE VIEW OF CEDAR RAPIDS IN 1868]

The friends of Smythe were very active among the democrats within the
county to obtain their support, knowing that a large number of
republicans would bolt the ticket. It was told that a fellow democrat
went to old man Hickey in College township, an old Irishman and a
stanch democrat, wanting him to vote for Smythe on the strength that he
was born in Ireland. Hickey replied, "What! ask me to vote for an
Orangeman, let me tell ye, when an Irishman steals a pig he gives half
of it to the priest; when an Orangeman steals a pig he takes the whole
d--thing and gives the priest nathing. No, I'll vote for no Orangeman
for any office, I tell ye."

Smythe was elected by a large majority and served until his death in
1870. Judge Smythe was one of the ablest men in the county; he had been
a delegate to the convention that nominated Lincoln for president, and
in 1861 was appointed to negotiate a bond issued by the state to
provide a war defense fund. He was also a colonel in the 31st Iowa
Infantry, and served in the field until December, 1864. Had he lived no
doubt he would have been one of the United States senators from Iowa,
and might have had the coveted place so long occupied by James Harlan
and William B. Allison.

In the Greeley contest there was not very much activity in politics in
the county, although a number who had previously affiliated with the
democratic party joined the republican ranks. The Blaine campaign was
one of the most bitter campaigns waged pro and con in the county. In
this campaign Milo P. Smith, of Linn, was the republican candidate for
congress against Ben Frederick, democrat, of Marshall county, who won
out against Smith on account of wrangling within the republican ranks.

John T. Hamilton, in another exciting contest for congress, won out as
a democrat against Geo. R. Struble, of Tama county, in 1890. Mr.
Hamilton had served in the legislature for six years previously and had
demonstrated his ability as an able and conservative legislator. He had
many stanch supporters in the district and especially in Linn county,
his home. Mr. Hamilton was defeated for re-election in 1892 by Robert
G. Cousins, of Cedar county, who held the seat continually till he was
succeeded by James W. Good, of Linn county, in the election of 1908.
Mr. Good was re-elected in the fall of 1910.

This article was not intended to deal with present politics, but with
past politics, and so the various contests which have been waged since
the Bryan campaign of 1896 will be left for other historians to
chronicle. The politicians of an early day in Linn county were men of
force and ability, who were interested in the material welfare of the
people of the state. These men always took a leading part in every
political and financial issue which arose, abhoring mere party
differences brought about for personal objects by selfish persons. Both
the leading parties possessed efficient leaders, who were fully
competent to cope with the issues under consideration from time to
time. These political leaders were efficient stump speakers, strong
political writers, financial backers and promoters of railroads and
steamboat lines. Their knowledge of the affairs of county and state
politics was unsurpassed, and as mere orators they held large
gatherings spellbound by their magnetic influence.

The politician of the old school was always a gentleman and would
seldom descend to anything low or unprofessional in order to obtain a
political victory over another. The instances cited in those pages are
only the occasional outbreak of party strife, or of selfish desire for
vengeance to satisfy some wrong, real or imaginary. Many of the party
leaders in the county in ye olden times, regardless of party
affiliations, were men of culture and education, conservative men,
keen, shrewd, and capable, who battled manfully, loyally, and
truthfully for the young state in its trying days in the beginning.
Nothing is more instructive than to read the early laws which were
passed and to meditate over the proceedings as found of three memorable
constitutional conventions. These deliberations show the good sense of
those who took part in debates, and while the discussions took a wide
range, the members never lost sight of the constitutional limitations
and of the legal status of the state to the federal government.

Such men as Abbe, the Smythe brothers, E. N. Bates, Durham, Col.
Preston, Judge Isbell, Strong, Gray, Kurtz, Col. Butler, Chandler
Jordan, Squire Nugent, Squire Ure, Isaac Cook, Col. W. H. Merritt,
Judge George Greene, Major M. A. Higley, and scores of other well known
pioneers were an honor to any community and in their respective
capacities wielded much influence in the county during the pioneer
days.

CHAPTER XXXVI

_Cedar Rapids_


Cedar Rapids is not a new town. True, it has not been flourishing for
centuries, like the old European cities, with histories which reach
back several centuries, but as cities and towns in the middle west are
spoken of, it has a lengthy history and one of more or less interest.
Young as it is, Cedar Rapids has no definite chronicle as to who was
the first actual settler. Dyer Usher claimed that he and a companion
gazed upon the beauty of its banks and admired the river at the upper
falls as early as 1836. Osgood Shepherd maintained that he was the
first actual settler, and that he opened a tavern here in 1837 or 1838.
He, at least, sold his squatter right in the embryo town, and made the
first property deal involving landed rights in what later became the
city. J. Wilbert Stone, also known as Bill Stone and William Stone, was
here as early as any white man. He was born in the state of Rhode
Island about 1803, and emigrated to Iowa Territory in the early
thirties. Stone was a well educated, quiet, and refined man, who
possessed all the traits of a trader. He drifted into Davenport and
Rock Island, and came to Westport some time after William Abbe. No
doubt he came from Rockingham up along the river looking for a place to
barter with Indians, and the few white men who might come along as
hunters and trappers. He conducted a small trading post at Westport
some time in 1837, but whether he was the first storekeeper in the
county is not known, as this honor has also been accorded to John
Henry. Whether Henry bought Stone out or not is not certain, but this
is true, that Stone disposed of his interests and removed ten miles by
trail up to the lower rapids, at the bend in the Red Cedar river, where
the large packing plant of the T. M. Sinclair Company now stands, and
here laid out a squatter town, which he called Columbus. This town site
is supposed to have been staked out on the east side of the river. The
time must have been in 1837. He quarreled with Shepherd, who either
came about the same time, or closely followed Stone. Stone, being a
quiet, peaceable person, still single, was compelled to cross the river
and take up a claim on the west side. Robert Ellis asserts that he
found the first small hut on May 8, 1838, on what became Cedar Rapids,
and that it was located on the east side near the packing plant, and
was occupied by Philip Hull. Had Shepherd sold this cabin to Hull after
having driven Stone across the river? That might be probable, as
Shepherd tried the same dodge on Ellis a few months later when he was
building a cabin on his claim on the west side of the river. In that
instance Shepherd had a prospective purchaser who was willing to go
into Ellis's shack, and but for the nerve and presence of mind of
Ellis, Shepherd might have succeeded. From Stone's daughter, still
living, it would seem that Stone was the first actual settler who came
here to trade with the Indians, and the first to lay out the squatter
town which later became Cedar Rapids, and that this plat or staking out
was on the east and not the west side of the river, all of which would
be natural as all the other squatter towns had been staked on the east
side, and thus were better defended from an attack of Indians or border
ruffians, who were apt to congregate more frequently on the west side
of the stream.

Robert Ellis walked into the town and found Hull, and later Shepherd,
located in a small cabin, which he called a tavern situated on the
river bank on what is now First avenue. Mr. Ellis also found at this
time John Young, a Scotchman, Granger, Fisher, and another Scot by the
name of Galloway. Shepherd laid claim at that time to nearly all of the
land on the east side of the river and especially the land adjoining
the dam site and the slough now called Cedar lake. A few hunters and
trappers came now and then and remained at the Shepherd cabin for days
at a time and then would depart as quietly as they had entered the
crude hotel on the river bank. It has been reported that Shepherd
harbored border ruffians and it has been said of him that while "he did
not willingly steal, he had not scruples about harboring those who
subsisted from that kind of traffic." So far as authentic records
indicate, we have no written or reliable sources of information except
hearsay, till Robert Ellis walked up the river and found the cabins of
Hull and Shepherd on the east side of the river, which property rights
were claimed by these parties as squatter owners. By this time Stone
had removed to the west side of the river and had already erected a
cabin. Being a single man he was not at home at all times, and thus
might have been away at the time Ellis arrived. Ellis soon discovered
from what Shepherd said as well as from what Stone had intimated, that
these men were at outs, and the best way to keep peace was to have the
river between them. Ellis had been out in the world long enough not to
mix in the quarrels of other men and to keep as close-mouthed as
possible about the troubles between sworn enemies. They never
associated after their quarrel. The daughter of Stone claims that her
father told her many times that the reason he sold out and removed to
the Iowa river bottom was on account of Shepherd's attitude and that of
the members of his gang toward him. These men feared that Stone would
inform on them and wanted him out of the way so long as he refused to
become an associate of theirs or in any way to approve of their
actions.

It would seem plausible that in a community where so many were law
violators and enemies of law and order a man like Stone would not be
tolerated and the ruffians would do all in their power to get him out
of the way by intimidation or otherwise.

N. B. Brown, from what we have been informed by N. E. Brown and others,
must have passed through what became Cedar Rapids as early as 1839 but
he did not locate here till the following year, when he first realized
the full value of the falls and the feasibility of a plan to erect a
suitable dam across the river which would furnish power to run saw and
grist mills. Galloway, Young, Granger, O. S. Bowling, and a few others
were here in the meantime, all holding down claims, but no one thought
of any future city to be founded or of any valuable asset in the water
power which had never been harnessed to machinery. What appealed to
them was the fact that the stream could be forded at this place, that
the banks had plenty of timber, and that it was a sort of way station
for straggling Indian trappers and hunters. Mr. Brown was not a
frontiersman but a mechanic, who was a trained miller and looked into
the future and saw that the location was ideal. While he had but little
money, he could see far enough ahead that here would be the logical
point for mills. Mr. Brown interested George Greene, H. W. Gray, A. L.
Roach, and S. H. Tryon, and they purchased from Osgood Shepherd an
undivided three-fourths interest for $3,000. The other one-fourth
interest was later sold by Shepherd to J. E. Sanford and Addison
Daniels. Mr. Shepherd had nothing but a squatter claim to sell, but
Brown and the others figured that it would be cheaper to buy him out
than to make a fight on him, and so the bargain was made. From an old
account book still in the possession of N. E. Brown, we cite the
following:

     "August 4, 1841. Commenced surveying 'Rapids City.' August 7,
     2-1/2 days by N. B. Brown, same, S. Durham, same, J. W.
     Carson, 1-1/2 days Geo. Greene, same, A. Daniels, 2-1/2 days
     O. Shepherd."

This proves that after the squatter right was purchased from Shepherd,
and the embryo town was first named by Brown the actual work of
surveying was commenced in August, 1841. All of the above named
persons became later well known in the county. Greene and Tryon were
clerks of court about this time, Durham was the newly arrived surveyor,
while Daniels became a merchant and prominent business man. Sanford was
an attorney and the owner of much land in this county, but died early
leaving his estate to his widow and aged father, who resided in
Connecticut. It would seem that Cedar Rapids was first called Columbus,
next Rapids City, and finally Cedar Rapids, taking its name from the
name of the river and the rapids which are formed here by the rock
foundations in the river bed.

Shepherd lingered around the place till the next year, when he found
that there was nothing further in his line, and that he was not
interested in corner lots or in any enterprises such as appealed to
Brown, David King, Greene, Sanford, Daniels, and many others. He
disposed of all his remaining rights and left for Wisconsin with his
family. He was later killed in a railway accident.

John Young also disposed of his squatter rights to Dr. J. R. Richey and
J. W. Carson. These purchasers sold again to Brown the following year.

J. L. Enos, a newspaper man, has the following to say of Shepherd,
writing in 1866: "The crimes committed by Shepherd and his gang were
for years a constant annoyance. John Young and a man by the name of
Granger were his immediate companions. The islands in the river,
particularly the one above the dam, were used as places to conceal
their plunder. A great many horses and much other property were stolen
by them, and in many cases they succeeded in hiding their booty. It is
known that this gang stole at one time six horses, getting away with
four of them. Granger was later caught in Chicago and tried for passing
counterfeit money. He was sent to the Alton prison for four years.
Young, it is stated on reliable authority, was executed in a
neighboring state, having been convicted of murder."

To prove that there is more or less truth in the stories as written of
Shepherd by Enos, Mr. Ellis says that shortly after he had located on
his claim and while he was building a cabin so as to hold his land,
Shepherd and some stranger came along one day and Shepherd insisted
that this was his claim and that Ellis should vacate as soon as he
could, as there would be trouble in store for a newcomer who had the
cheek to jump a claim of this kind. Ellis was much surprised and could
not believe that Shepherd, with whom he had stayed for a short time,
would come at him with such unfounded accusations. He had heard of the
trouble with Stone and knew from Hull that Shepherd was not a very good
man. Hull seemed to be all right. Ellis made up his mind that in a game
of bluff he would not take a back seat, and that he had not come all
the way from Pennsylvania on foot for nothing. He got mad and then did
not stop to count noses, but raised his ax and came towards Shepherd,
saying in his most emphatic way that the claim was his and that some
one would get killed before he gave it up. He said he had picked out
and improved the land and by right owned it till such time as the
government saw fit to throw it open for settlement. He then accused
Shepherd of some of the things he had heard and offered to back it up
by proof if he wanted it. He said further, "You have bluffed others out
of their claims, but you can't bluff me. You get off my land or I shall
be compelled to use my ax." Shepherd moved away and the stranger turned
pale and was uncertain whether he should run or stand there with his
hands raised. He had never been in such a place before. Never again was
Ellis molested, nor did Shepherd again refer to the unpleasant
incident.

It was later rumored that Shepherd for a consideration was to locate
the stranger on a good claim. He figured that as Ellis had already a
cabin partially built this would be a good chance to get a bit of money
and he reasoned that a stranger in the country would soon give in. He
had not figured on the fact that Ellis was "the bravest of the brave,"
when it came to a question of asserting his own rights, which he knew
were just. From this little episode as to the character of Shepherd as
displayed toward Ellis it would seem that Shepherd might have gone at
Stone in the same manner in which he tried to treat Ellis, and by force
and intimidation made him give up his claim. Shepherd's course while a
citizen of Linn county was not an honorable one and few, if any, of his
associates speak of him except in an unfavorable light.

In April, 1839, arrived Joe and John Listebarger, who erected a small
log house at what is now 818 North First street west and owned by
Ferdinand Uebel. A younger brother, Isaac, arrived later the same
summer. William Knowles erected a house on what later became known as
Mound Farm. John Stambaugh built a log house in what is now Bever Park,
which later was disposed of to John G. Cole. The upper part of the west
side was settled by Farnham Colby, who came shortly after Ellis had
staked out his holdings. During the years 1838-39 came others, such as
Thos. Gainor, Joel and James Leverich, P. W. Earle, and many others. It
was in July of this year that the family of Isaac Carroll arrived and
located a little to the east of what is now Cedar Rapids. A son of
Isaac Carroll, the Rev. George R. Carroll, writes as follows in his
_Pioneer Life_: "I cannot now recall anything of importance on the way
until we reached Linn Grove, where we found a few log cabins. In
conversation with one of the women who occupied one of these primitive
abodes we found that her language was so different from anything we had
heard, that it left a decided impression on our minds and was a source
of no little amusement to us children. Some of her peculiar expressions
were by-words with us for many years. She seemed very cordial and ready
as everybody was in welcoming newcomers, and she was quite
communicative, although her accounts were not always of the most
encouraging and inspiring character to the new arrivals.

     "It was in the afternoon of July 4th, 1839, when we reached
     the county seat and the only thing to mark the spot was a
     bower of bushes under which our nation's birthday had been
     celebrated in primitive style and in which, judging from
     hilarious demonstrations of two or three men that we met on
     the way, whiskey must have played a somewhat conspicuous
     part. A little at one side of the town L. M. Strong had a
     little cabin. I do not remember of having seen either the
     cabin or the tenants at the time but Mr. Strong was for many
     years after a well known and highly honored citizen of this
     place. Passing on beyond Marion we crossed Indian creek about
     a mile north of the present crossings and where there was a
     beautiful crystal spring, near which was a little cabin
     occupied by Mr. James W. Bassett. From this point, turning in
     a southwesterly direction, we found our way by a dim track
     through the woods reaching, towards night, the little bark
     shanty of Ephraim T. Lewis, near where now stands the stone
     barn just south of the boulevard two miles west of Marion.
     Mr. Lewis and his son-in-law, Nathaniel G. Niece, were there
     and gave us a most hearty welcome and most cordial invitation
     to share their hospitality over night, which we gladly
     accepted.

     "The next day we passed a half mile west to the little hut of
     Mr. Jewell, later occupied by Barnet Lutz. Passing on sixty
     or eighty rods west of Mr. Jewell's through the tall grass we
     found Mr. A. B. Mason breaking up prairie on the higher
     ground just north of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul
     Railway at a point forty or fifty rods west of the boulevard
     crossing at Kenwood. This, I think, was the first furrow
     plowed between Marion and Cedar Rapids. Passing Mr. Mason, we
     found ourselves in a few moments on the ground which was to
     be our future home. At a point of the ridge near the mound,
     which in later years has been extensively known as Judge
     Greene's Mound Farm, we pitched our tent, the little brook
     near by affording us water, and the grove close at hand
     furnishing wood and poles and bushes for the erection of a
     bower, which for a few days were to serve us as a kitchen and
     dining room."

In this company came also B. F. and C. C. Cook, step-sons of Isaac
Carroll, and Sarah Carroll, a step-daughter. There were also the
following children: Isaac W., George R., and Julia Carroll.

Mr. Carroll, in his interesting recollections of pioneer days, speaks
of a number of people who at this time and in the next few years
resided in and around Cedar Rapids, such as William Vineyard, who
married Sarah Carroll, and various members of the Lewis family, who
arrived that same fall. James Ferguson and his family, the Weare
family, William Stewart, A. Sines, Arvin Kennedy, Isaac and William
Cook, members of the Ely families, Dr. J. W. Traer, J. F. Charles, the
Daniels families, and many others came a little later.

Thus within a few years from the time that Brown and others purchased
the claims of Shepherd, the scene along the banks of the Red Cedar had
changed from an Indian wilderness and a resort of border ruffians to a
landscape bearing all the evidences of a high degree of civilization.
The old Indian burial grounds became the place of a Christian cemetery,
and the pole tepees covered with leaves and skins were removed to make
place for commodious log houses, erected by the whites.

In a study of the beginnings in Cedar Rapids it has seemed to the
writer that heretofore due amount of credit for his work has not been
given to N. B. Brown. His was indeed a constructive genius. He early
interested himself in and in many instances began businesses that gave
employment to labor, the backbone of any thrifty community. His
enterprises were not always successful ones, whose are? All of them,
however, were busy institutions for a time, and while they were going
they gave employment to many people. It seemed to be the rule to send
strangers in the city seeking employment to Nick Brown if no one else
had use for their services, they being told that Mr. Brown was sure to
give them something to do.

And he always did as it was intimated he would do.

His manufacturing industries were many and varied. He built and
operated saw and flour mills, woollen and knitting factories, at one
time conducting two saw mills in the city, one on each side of the
Cedar. He also at one time ran a saw mill on Indian Creek, south of
town. He built a starch factory at McCloud's Run, and when this failed
owing to the dismissal by his foreman of the only man who knew the
secrets of the manufacture he converted the mill into a distillery,
thus making a market for the corn raised in the county.

Some of his early account books are now in the possession of his son,
N. E. Brown. They show page after page of names of employes in his
various manufacturing enterprises.

It is scarcely possible at this date to give a proper estimate to the
value of his services to the infant city. Pioneers of the energy and
public spirit manifested by Mr. Brown were indeed of great benefit to
the community in which they wrought, and honor and credit ought to be
extended accordingly.

We are glad here to testify to the great worth of Mr. Brown along
industrial lines in the pioneer days of our beautiful and prosperous
Cedar Rapids.

For the first few years the settlers got along as best they could. They
had few if any luxuries. Dubuque and Muscatine were the nearest
markets. It required from six to fourteen days to make the trip and
frequently longer when the roads were bad and when fierce storms
overtook the party. Robert Ellis built three flat boats in the winter
of 1841 and took a cargo of wheat to Burlington, trading this for a
cargo of flour which he delivered safely at New Orleans, in July of
that year. He got back during the summer but did not make any money out
of the enterprise and never again cared to try the experiment. Many
years later he received a settlement with the Burlington firm which was
hard pressed for money and could not pay for the 4,000 bushels he had
delivered. So while he did not get a fortune he perhaps came out even
on this hazardous trip.

While it is true this daring enterprise failed to make Robert Ellis a
wealthy man it did stir people up to the possibility of river traffic
and that of course helped. The venture was talked over and over time
and again, flat boats were built now and then, and a little grain
shipped. Small steamers made Cedar Rapids in the early spring of the
year, bringing a few groceries and notions, and taking away wheat,
oats, pork, and a little corn.

Artificial dams in the river were talked of but that was as far as it
went. No one was able to have any pull with the legislatures. Robert
Holmes, an old Marion resident, had a grain house at Ivanhoe, and took
cargoes of grain down the river in 1844, '46 and '51; Henry Thomson
also ran a few flat boats on the river as far as St. Louis.

In 1858 a body of enterprising young men had built the steamer "Cedar
Rapids" at Beaver, Pennsylvania, at a cost of $20,000, the stockholders
being Wm. and George Greene, J. F. Ely, H. G. Angle, L. Daniels & Co.,
and W. W. Smith. This steamer ran during much of the spring and summer
and late into the fall, and did a big business. But within two years in
an accident on the Mississippi river the "Cedar Rapids" ran into
another steamer, litigation ensued, and the owners lost everything they
had made as well as the steamer.

Thus ended the first big adventure of the Cedar Rapids spirit. In the
same year another steamer, the "Black Hawk," was built to run up the
river to Waterloo and for a time did fair business. This was owned by
W. D. Watrous, J. J. Snouffer, W. W. Smith, J. Stanley, and several
others. This steamboat was sold to the government during the war and
used as a supply steamer on the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers. At one
time N. B. Brown was the owner of the boat. Just as the people were
demanding that another company be formed to invest in another steamer
enterprise the railways came, and now these daring business men
centered their efforts in developing railroads and won out, but not
until after many struggles, and after many failures. The people of Linn
county surveyed, planned, and talked about several lines before they
could realize the benefits of any.

The Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railway was organized in what is now
Clinton on January 26, 1856, the first officers being Charles Walker,
of Chicago, president, James Purdy, of Mansfield, Ohio, vice president,
T. T. Davis, of Syracuse, New York, treasurer, R. H. Norton, secretary,
and Milo Smith, of Clinton county, engineer. Many Cedar Rapids
residents put up money and notes to have the road come through the
city. Most of the necessary means were put up by eastern capitalists
and especially by John I. Blair, one of the most enterprising of the
early railroad promoters in America. Mr. Blair was born in New Jersey
in 1802 and passed away in 1892, one of the most noted men of this
country. He was at least in an early day the owner of more miles of
railways than any other man in the world, and had laid out more town
sites and villages in Iowa and Nebraska than any other person in the
west. It was John I. Blair who first saw the opportunity of making
Cedar Rapids a center on account of its progressive people, the water
power, and other advantages which this practical, wide-awake railway
man saw here, and which were lacking in other localities. In June,
1859, the road was completed to Cedar Rapids. Its coming was the most
important event in the history of the city. It was the beginning of the
end in the unique struggle for railways in Linn county, and marks an
epoch in the history of the city.

The road was extended west, and by 1862 the trains were running as far
as Marshalltown. By 1867 the road was completed to the Missouri river.
Both the Iowa and Nebraska and the Cedar Rapids and Missouri River
railways have for many years been under one management and are now
known as the Chicago and Northwestern Railway, which owns and operates
nearly 8,000 miles of road with a capital stock of $130,121,838.

[Illustration: BIRDSEYE VIEW Of CEDAR RAPIDS IN 1889]

In 1865 D. W. C. Rowley began grading for the Burlington, Cedar Rapids
and Northern Railway, which was organized in Cedar Rapids. A separate
company, known as the Cedar Valley Construction Company, was organized
to build this line to Waterloo. This company was composed of such men
as Dr. J. F. Ely, president, William Greene, superintendent, D. W. C.
Rowley, secretary. In December, 1866, another road was incorporated,
running to Burlington south via Iowa City. The men connected with this
enterprise were J. H. Gear, Burlington, president, J. E. Putnam,
Burlington, secretary, directors Dr. S. D. Carpenter, of Cedar Rapids,
E. Clark and Peter A. Dey, of Iowa City, and John Bird, Louisa county.

This southern branch did not progress rapidly and there was more or
less of a hitch with the plans, and a question as to how the road
should run. The articles were changed, leaving out Iowa City, and the
board increased to fifteen members, among whom may be mentioned N. B.
Brown, George Greene, and Charles Weare, who were added from Linn
county. George Greene was elected president and Charles Mason, vice
president. By June, 1868, the two roads were united under one name, the
Burlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern, Greene becoming president, and D.
W. C. Rowley secretary. By January 1, 1871, trains were running between
Cedar Rapids and Burlington, and early the following year they reached
to St. Paul, thus making one of the first great north and south roads
in Iowa. For many years C. J. Ives was president of the road till it
was absorbed by the Rock Island system, when the headquarters were
transferred to Chicago, the Cedar Rapids office becoming merely a
division point.

The Dubuque and Southwestern Railway was operated from Dubuque to Cedar
Rapids in October, 1865. This was an important factor in the upbuilding
of Marion and other towns along this road and in fact helped Cedar
Rapids. Like all small roads, it was not a financial success, and in
May, 1878, it was sold to the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway
Company and new life put into it. The Milwaukee road in 1883 extended
this line to Kansas City. The main line of the Milwaukee was extended
to Omaha.

The building of the interurban to Iowa City, a distance of twenty-eight
miles, a few years ago concludes the railway building in Linn county,
with the exception of the Anamosa and Northwestern, which runs along
the northern part of the county; and the extension of the Illinois
Central, which runs down from Manchester, connecting with the main line
at that place.

We are pleased to give space here to the following account of
beginnings in Cedar Rapids. It is from Bailey & Hair's _Gazetteer_ for
1865:

     "D. W. King and T. Gainor were the first settlers of any
     advantage to the county. They reached here in 1839, and soon
     after made a permanent settlement on the west side of the
     river.

     "The first white man, however, who pitched his tent on the
     ground, now occupied by the Valley City, was a notorious
     counterfeiter and horse thief by the name of Shepherd, who
     took up his abode and erected his cabin on what is now
     Commercial street, near the mills, in the year 1838.

     "Thus early was this location selected as a central point
     for commercial operations with the surrounding country, and
     although the character of the operators was worse than some
     who have followed them in business, it nevertheless
     indicates their wisdom in making a good location for their
     enterprise.

     "In 1849 D. W. King established ferries for crossing the
     river, and continued to run them up to the time of his
     death, in 1854. They were located at Iowa avenue and Linn
     street crossings. They were self-propellers, being forced
     across the river by the power of the current. A wire rope or
     cable extended across the stream upon which a pulley was
     placed, and connected by ropes to the boat. The first dam
     across the Cedar river was commenced in 1842, and the first
     saw mill erected in 1843.

     "In March, 1843, the lands came into market. The first
     flouring mill was erected by N. B. Brown, in 1844-5, at a
     cost of $3,000. Extensive additions have been made to this
     mill since. It is still owned and run by Mr. Brown. In 1845,
     A. Ely erected the second saw mill and the following year
     the second flouring mill at a cost of $9,000. In 1848-9, the
     first woolen factory was erected by N. B. Brown. Cost,
     $10,000. The first steam engine was set in operation in
     1855, in the machine shop of A. Hager.

     "The first store was owned by J. Greene in the building now
     standing on the northeast corner of Iowa avenue and
     Washington street. The second store was opened by Mr.
     Cleveland, and the third by Mr. Mulford. The proprietor of
     these stores have all left the city. Mulford's store was
     destroyed by fire in 1850, being the first building thus
     destroyed in Cedar Rapids. The second fire occurred in 1855,
     when the buildings on the west side of Commercial street,
     between Iowa avenue and Linn street, were mostly consumed.
     The postoffice was established in 1847, and J. Greene
     appointed postmaster.

     "The first brick building was erected in 1844, on the
     northwest corner of Iowa avenue and Washington street, by P.
     W. Earle, and is now occupied by him. The Union House, on
     the northwest corner of Adams and Market streets, was the
     first hotel. It was destroyed by fire early in 1865. The
     first school house was erected in 1847, and the first school
     taught by Nelson Felch. This structure is now occupied as a
     dwelling on the north side of Eagle street between Jefferson
     and Madison. The first white child born was the daughter of
     John Vardy, now removed to Texas. The first church erected
     is that commonly known as the 'Muddy,' and is still used as
     a house of worship. It is a small 'grout' building at the
     southeast corner of Eagle and Adams streets. The first death
     was that of a young man by the name of William Brookey, some
     time in 1843. The first frame building was built by John
     Vardy.

     "The lodge of Free Masons was established in 1850, and James
     Keeler, an Episcopal minister, was the first W. M. The lodge
     took the name of Cedar Rapids Lodge No. 25. Its name was
     changed in 1864 to the more euphonious and Masonic name of
     Crescent.

     "The first newspaper was established by D. O. Finch, in
     1854. Three volumes only were issued. D. O. Finch, James J.
     Child, and James L. Enos, were successively its editors. The
     _Era_ was purchased in 1854 by James L. Enos, and the name
     changed to the _Cedar Valley Times_, by which name it still
     flourishes. C. M. Hollis, Esq., is the present editor. The
     second paper was the _Cedar Valley Farmer_, J. L. Enos,
     editor. The _Cedar Rapids Democrat_ was the third paper
     established, by W. W. Perkins & Co., in 1856. The _Voice of
     Iowa_ was commenced in January, 1857, by the Iowa State
     Teachers' Association, and J. L. Enos elected editor. This
     journal reached a large circulation, and did much to give
     form to the school system of the state. The present public
     school edifice was erected in 1856-7-8, at a cost of some
     $15,000. It has six departments, and employs seven or eight
     teachers.

     "Cedar Rapids was incorporated as a city in 1856, and Isaac
     Newton Whittam, Esq., was chosen the first mayor. A free
     bridge was constructed across the Cedar in 1855-6, but was
     soon carried away by the ice. As it fell, a large number
     were standing on the banks watching the ice as it rapidly
     tore the stone piers from their positions. Two sisters,
     daughters of Mr. Black, passed by the guard, which was
     stationed at the end of the bridge to keep the people from
     passing on, and had reached about the middle, when the frail
     fabric went down. Both young ladies were drowned, and the
     body of one was never recovered. A toll bridge was erected
     the following year, and though a slender structure, has thus
     far withstood the action of the ice, though occasionally
     broken down by cattle passing over it.


     "KINGSTON CITY

     "Is a place of about 350 inhabitants, situated on the west
     side of the Cedar river, opposite the city of Cedar Rapids.
     It is connected with this city by a wooden bridge, and is
     about one-quarter of a mile from the Cedar Rapids depot of
     the Chicago and Northwestern railroad. In the year 1838
     Robert Ellis and O. Bowling settled on land in the vicinity,
     and in the year following Messrs. Isaac, John, and Joseph
     Lichtebarger settled where Kingston now stands. During the
     summer following David W. King and Thomas Gainor arrived
     here. The first child born was Mary Jane, daughter of T. and
     R. Gainor, on the 15th of May, 1840. Rosannah Gainor died on
     the 8th of June, 1840. This was the first death in the
     place. There is in the place one paper mill, one saw mill,
     two blacksmith shops, two groceries, and one dry goods
     store. There are three religious societies, Methodist
     Episcopal, Congregationalist, and United Presbyterian. There
     is also a commodious building for school purposes, and three
     libraries. This region of country is especially adapted to
     growing grain. Large quantities are annually shipped to
     Chicago from this place. The immense water-power will at no
     distant day make this a large manufacturing town."

The following as to early things in Cedar Rapids is taken from a copy
of the _Cedar Valley Times_, J. L. Enos, editor, in 1865:

     "On the 4th day of July, 1841, N. B. Brown began
     construction of a dam for utilization of the power. Carson,
     Gray and Roach soon sold their interests to Messrs. Brown
     and Greene, who became the sole proprietors of the
     water-power, and constructed the first saw mill in 1842-3.
     This mill is yet standing in the rear of Brown's flouring
     mill, which was also the first grist mill, and erected in
     1843, and extensively enlarged by the present owner in
     1854-5.

     "The first blacksmith in the place was Harrison Campbell,
     who opened a shop in Shepherd's old cabin in 1843. Isaac
     Cook, Esq., was the first lawyer, John L. Shearer the first
     justice, and James Lewis the first constable. The name of
     the first physician seems to be lost from the memory of the
     'early day,' though many of his peculiar traits of character
     are remembered. Like some others in the profession he was
     disposed to blow his own trumpet, and the stories he told to
     the uninitiated ones were marvelous in the extreme. Once
     when he had returned from Muscatine he claimed to have lost
     forty pounds of quinine in one of the streams which put into
     the Cedar below the city--the water being unusually high.
     His credit was evidently then better than afterward, as was
     also his physical courage. Constable Lewis, at one time
     called upon him with an execution to secure a judgment, when
     the doctor becoming wrathy, threw off his coat for a fight.
     The constable being more intent on collecting the claim than
     emulous for notoriety as a pugilist, seized the coat and
     made away with it--finding a sufficient amount of money to
     pay the debt. Dr. S. M. Brice remained here for a few months
     and then removed to Center Point. Dr. E. L. Mansfield was
     the first physician who made a permanent location in this
     city, and still enjoys a large and lucrative practice. He
     came here in 1847 and has ever since been engaged in the
     noble endeavor--to heal the thousand natural ills that flesh
     is heir to.

     "The first brick building was erected in 1844, by P. W.
     Earle, Esq., on the west corner of Iowa avenue and
     Washington street. This building is still occupied by Mr.
     Earle, and shows but little the marks of age. A three-story
     brick store was erected the same year on the south corner of
     Iowa avenue and Commercial street. This building has since
     been removed to make room for the block of stores extending
     from Iowa avenue down the west side of Commercial street
     toward Eagle street. Greene's hotel, a fine-appearing brick
     hotel four stories high, also occupied a portion of this
     ground. It was erected in 1853-4 by George Greene, and was
     kept by various persons as a first-class hotel until it was
     taken down to make room for a new brick block, which was
     erected in 1862.

     "The first store proper was opened in the building now
     standing on the north corner of Iowa avenue and Washington
     street, by Joseph Greene. As early as 1842 Mr. Greene had a
     store in one part of a log building located on the north
     corner of Commercial and Sugar streets, the other end of the
     same building being occupied as a boarding house or hotel.

     "The first building erected for a hotel was built by William
     Dwyer in 1847, James Gunning being the first landlord. The
     building was destroyed by fire in January, 1865. It was
     known as the Union House and was located on the west corner
     of Market and Adams streets.

     "The Adventists held meetings here as early as 1842-3; a Mr.
     Baker being the minister. The Protestant and Episcopal
     Methodists also had organizations at an early day. The
     Presbyterians organized soon after and erected the first
     church edifice, known as the 'Big Muddy,' taking its name
     from the material of which it was composed. It is a grout
     building, occupying the east corner of Eagle street and
     Adams street. The Universalists had an organization here
     quite early and were 'ministered unto' by Rev. Mr. Westfall.
     In either 1843 or '44 a somewhat noted discussion was held
     between Mr. Westfall, the Universalist, and Mr. Roberts, Old
     School Presbyterian, at which Joseph Greene acted as umpire.
     The discussion continued for four days and nights. The
     meetings were largely attended and the combatants were sharp
     and excited. The conflict ended as such discussions usually
     do--in the victory of both--and this was regarded by nearly
     all as a drawn game.

     "The first school was kept by Miss Emily Coffman. The first
     school building was erected in 1846-7, by a company
     consisting of N. B. Brown, George Greene, Alex. Ely, and
     others, who sold it to the district, and had the
     satisfaction of being taxed to pay themselves for it. This
     building was on the north side of Eagle street between
     Jefferson and Madison. It is still standing and is occupied
     as a dwelling house. Nelson Felch was among the first
     teachers, also a Mr. Freeman, who has since been receiving
     instruction in a state institution located at Fort Madison.

     "The second saw mill was erected by Alex Ely in 1844 and the
     second flouring mill in 1844-5. Mr. Ely died shortly after
     the completion of this mill. In 1848 N. B. Brown built the
     first woolen factory. The first steam engine was put up here
     in 1855 by A. Hager, in his sash, door and blind
     manufactory. He had an extensive amount of machinery
     connected with it and employed a number of workmen.

     "The second store was established by Mr. Cleveland, and the
     third by C. K. Mulford. Mulford's store was afterward
     occupied as a dwelling, on the east corner of Commercial and
     Linn streets, and was destroyed by fire in 1850. That was
     the first fire in Cedar Rapids, and none occurred after it
     until the autumn of 1855, when most of the block on the west
     side of Commercial street, between Iowa avenue and Linn
     street, was destroyed. No precautions have been taken to
     prevent the spread of the destroying element, and were a
     fire to occur tomorrow no more means would be found of
     subduing it than existed twenty years ago. It would seem
     that a wise people would not thus neglect what may at any
     moment be of such vast importance. But so it is, and so it
     is likely to remain until a fire shall occur that will lay
     in ruins a large portion of our city and destroy thousands
     of dollars worth of property. Personal insurance can best
     cover a part of this loss and perhaps not one-half are
     provided with this protection."

The old map was made in 1859 and the only copy now in existence is the
property of Mr. Lew W. Anderson. It is yellow, faded and dim and in
many parts was difficult to trace. It has been used many times as
evidence in court in legal contests over property rights. The
reproduction shows clearly the original plat of the city including
Kingston, the islands, parks, squares, blocks, additions, stations,
streets, names, etc. The street names have nearly all been changed
since that time.]

Dr. Seymour D. Carpenter, who came to Cedar Rapids in 1849, contributed
the below quoted memoirs to a _History of Crescent Lodge_, J. E.
Morcombe, author, and published by the lodge in 1906. It is of value in
the consideration of the history of early times in the city and county:

     "I wished to read law, but there was a family prejudice
     against the profession, and I concluded to study medicine
     and accordingly entered as a student the office of Drs.
     Boerstler & Edwards, who were among the leading physicians.
     There for a year I read books that were full of what are now
     exploded theories and practice, at the end of which time I
     was sent to the University of Pennsylvania, where two years
     after I was graduated as a doctor of medicine. Returning
     home in the spring of 1849, I remained but a few months and
     then started west 'to grow up with the country.' I again
     rode to Cincinnati on horseback, took steamer to St. Louis,
     thence by another boat up the Illinois river to Haverville.
     Not liking the place, I rode west and crossed the
     Mississippi at Quincy and went to Kirksville in Missouri.
     Still not pleased, I turned north and went to Ottumwa, Iowa,
     where I met Judge Greene, then a member of the supreme bench
     of Iowa. He persuaded me that Cedar Rapids was in the near
     future to become a metropolis, and I decided to go there.
     After four days' hard riding and swimming several swollen
     streams, I struck the town on the afternoon of the 14th of
     June, 1849. I crossed the river on a rope ferry operated by
     David King, who lived in a cabin on the west side. On the
     other side of the river stood the cabin once the home of a
     man named Shepherd, and said to have been the resort of
     thieves in an earlier day. I cannot say that I was very
     favorably impressed by the thirty or forty mostly one-story
     unpainted houses that were scattered about near the river.
     There seemed to be a great deal of sand, and the houses were
     so situated that there was no sign of a street. There were
     three two-story houses, one on the river near the foot of
     what is now Third avenue, called the 'Park house,' in which
     the Greenes had their store; one on second street in which
     John Coffman kept a hotel, and one on Third avenue, back of
     the Dows & Ely block, also a hotel, but keeper's name
     forgotten. I was discouraged and would have traveled further
     but only had about ten dollars left, and from necessity had
     to stop. I put up at the Coffman hotel, which, as I have
     said, was a two-story structure with a wing. It had been
     built of unseasoned oak lumber and was not plastered. The
     whole of the second story of the main building was in one
     room, and contained eight or ten beds and was the common
     sleeping room of the guests. The lumber had shrunk and there
     could be no complaint as to ventilation, however short the
     accommodations might be in other respects. I had hardly got
     settled before I was interviewed by old Joe Leverich, a
     noted character of Linn county of that day. He was known as
     the 'Bogus Coon,' because, as was alleged, he had to do with
     counterfeiters. He was a power in politics and was the kind
     of a man from which the modern 'pop' has evoluted. Joe
     looked me over, asked where I was from, where I was going,
     what my business was, etc., etc. I was somewhat indignant
     and tried to be sarcastic, but Joe, in terminating his
     interview, squelched me by remarking: 'Young man, a fellow
     that wears such a hat as you do may pass in this country,
     but I consider it d--d doubtful.' I unfortunately wore a
     'plug' hat which was not the style in Iowa a half century
     ago. In subsequent years Joe and I became fast friends, and
     I became quite convinced that the shady stories told of him
     were the talk of enemies who were jealous of him because he
     was smarter than the great majority of them. I was with him
     when he died, and, although a free-thinker, he passed away
     with all the calmness of a stoic philosopher.

     "Within a week I made the acquaintance of all the people of
     the town. Among the leading persons were William and Joseph
     Greene, brothers of the judge, Lowell and Lawson Daniels,
     Homer Bishop and John Weare, all of whom were merchants.
     The three stores of which they were the proprietors would
     not compare well with the department stores of today, but
     all the same they were department stores, and in their
     miscellaneous stocks the customer could find all he wanted,
     from castor oil to broad-axes. Pollock & Stewart were the
     blacksmiths, and the carpenters and wagon-makers were also
     represented, but I cannot recall their names.

     "Dr. Mansfield took me as a partner, and in company with
     Judge Cook, we had a room, 10x16, in a small one-story
     building opposite the mill, the other part being occupied by
     S. L. Pollock and family. His blacksmith shop was near by.
     Our medicines were kept on a shelf and a store box made a
     table. Our bunks occupied one side and a few stools and two
     split-bottomed chairs made up our furniture. We took our
     meals at the Coffman house. Our field of practice embraced
     the settlers, not numerous, in the valleys of the Cedar and
     Iowa rivers and their tributaries. We made very long rides.
     I was called to see a patient two miles above the present
     town of Vinton, not then begun. I got lost in the night and
     waited for daylight under a tree on the bank of the river at
     the very spot where Vinton now stands. Bilious fever and
     ague were the prevailing diseases, all the newcomers having
     to undergo one or both. As patients and clients were not
     very numerous, we had a good deal of leisure. Judge Cook was
     a fine reader and we took turns at Shakespeare, a copy of
     which we fortunately possessed. During the summer Dr.
     Mansfield and myself built a story and half office on
     Commercial street, about the middle of the block on which
     the Daniels store was located. We had a mail three times a
     week from Dubuque and Iowa City. The Higley brothers did the
     service in a two-horse hack. I think Joseph Greene was
     postmaster. John Weare, Sr., was justice of the peace. He
     was a very original character, fond of company and full of
     interesting reminiscences extending back to the war of 1812,
     in which he had lost a leg. His small office was in the rear
     of Mrs. Ely's residence, which stood on the ground where the
     Dows & Ely block now is. He gave 'nicknames' to many people
     and places which stuck to them like burrs. The first
     Presbyterian or Congregational church building was begun
     that summer, and as the walls were built of cement, old Mr.
     Weare named it the 'Muddy,' which it retained to the last
     day of its existence. Many buildings were put up that year
     with a corresponding increase in population. All the people
     were full of hope and ambition. We began to talk of
     railroads. The people of Dubuque and Keokuk, the leading
     river towns, started a scheme for a road running through the
     interior and connecting them. The people along the line, at
     Cascade, Anamosa, Marion, Cedar Rapids, Washington and
     Fairfield eagerly endorsed the project, meetings were held
     and it was resolved to hold two delegate conventions, on the
     same day, one at Anamosa, the other at Fairfield. We had a
     rousing meeting in Cedar Rapids. There were nearly a hundred
     people present, and they resolved to have the railroad
     forthwith. From our standpoint it was the government's duty
     to donate land, and for eastern people to furnish the money.
     Delegates were chosen to both conventions. Dr. John F. Ely
     and myself were selected to go to Fairfield. Both
     conventions were to be held on the 6th of December, 1849. We
     left Cedar Rapids on the 3d of December and after three
     days' hard and cold travel reached Fairfield. Marion sent
     Col. I. M. Preston and Dr. Ristine. The convention met in a
     small school house. All the counties were represented. The
     Hon. C. W. Slagle, of Fairfield, then a very young man, was
     chosen president. I was chosen secretary. The little school
     house was packed, and if any doubt the courage and scope of
     that convention, let him look up the old file of newspapers
     of that day and read. Dr. Ballard, of Iowa City, Stewart
     Goodsel, of Brighton, Joseph Casey, of Keokuk county, and
     General Van Plank Van Antwerp were present and took active
     part. We parted for our various homes, thinking the work
     half done, but sad to relate, Cedar Rapids had to wait ten
     years longer for the locomotive. These two meetings were,
     as I think, the first railroad conventions held in the
     interior of the state. Soon opposition schemes were started
     for east and west lines, and our project was ignominiously
     called the 'Ram's Horn.' The next year was quite a stirring
     one. New people were coming in great numbers, but many were
     leaving, for the California fever had broken out. Several
     outfits left Cedar Rapids, and with one of them Dr.
     Mansfield, my partner, whose place was taken by Dr. S. C.
     Koontz, a cousin of mine, one well known to the old
     citizens. That year the first brick buildings were erected,
     a dwelling on Iowa avenue near Greene's opera house, and a
     three-story building on Commercial street, by Judge Greene,
     which for a long time was the show building of the town. We
     began to put on city airs.

     "At this time Martin L. Barber was mayor of the village. It
     was before the present city organization. Barber was an
     eccentric character, a millwright by trade. He was nearly as
     wise as Solomon, with courage to match. A 'bad man' came to
     the town. He hung about the saloon. It was said he drew a
     knife and threatened to kill a citizen. The majesty of the
     law was invoked. It was night. The offender took refuge in
     the saloon and barricaded the door. The mayor called out the
     'posse commitatus' numbering two or three dozen young
     fellows like myself. He pounded on the door, demanding
     admittance in the name of the law. No response. We got a
     piece of timber and battered down the door. The mayor
     collared the 'bad man' who offered no resistance. He was
     hurried towards the Coffman house, where the mayor proposed
     to deal out justice. As we neared the hotel he tore loose
     from the mayor and made for the river. We in full cry in
     pursuit. He plunged in just below the mill. We paused at the
     brink. Gradually he disappeared, and was never seen
     afterwards. It was the first and last exhibition of the
     mayor's power.

     "In 1850 Miss Mary S. Legare, sister of the Hon. Hugh S.
     Legare of South Carolina, came to Cedar Rapids. She was a
     woman of the highest culture, who had moved much in the
     official circles of Washington, and had considerable wealth.
     With her came numerous relatives named Bryan, Storey, and
     McIntosh, the latter a well known lawyer of the early days.
     She made investments in the town and took up large tracts of
     land. In the spring of that year we had a very spirited
     election. The people were divided into two factions, the
     'codfish' and the 'catfish.' For mayor the former nominated
     N. B. Brown, the latter Jacob Bressler. I cannot recall the
     issues, but only remember that we almost came to blows
     during the canvass. Less than one hundred votes were cast
     and Brown was elected. Brown was one of the original owners
     of the town site, and built the first mills. He was one of
     the prominent characters in the early history of the town, a
     modest, quiet, but genial man, with many friends.

     "This year, on the 6th of July, I did one of the few wise
     acts of my life. I married Sarah Weare, the daughter of John
     Weare, Sr. We went to housekeeping in a small one-story
     house, near where the old passenger depot stood. It was then
     the only house east of the present railroad. The next year,
     1851, was a very active one for the town. Judge Greene, who
     had lived in Dubuque, moved to the town. The same year came
     S. C. Bever, who had driven in a two-horse buggy from Holmes
     county, Ohio, to Cedar Rapids. By this time I considered
     myself an old citizen, thoroughly identified with the county
     and town, and devoted all my leisure time to meeting
     strangers and exploiting the town and county. I met Mr.
     Bever soon after his arrival and spent several days with him
     riding about the country. He made large investments both in
     country and town. One was 160 acres about a mile from the
     ferry, at $5.00 per acre. I made the sale for Mr. Addison
     Daniels of Marion, who was so pleased with my effort that he
     presented me with a four-bladed penknife. Both Mr. Daniels
     and myself were satisfied and I have never heard that Mr.
     Bever regretted the purchase. That same year my father, Mr.
     Gabriel Carpenter, came out to see the country. After great
     effort on my part and many misgivings on his, he purchased
     of Mr. Levi Lewis 300 acres of land adjoining the town plat
     on the south, for which he paid $2,500. The land embraced
     the present cemetery. By this time Judge Greene had
     completed his three-story building, into which the Greene
     Bros. placed a large stock of goods. The most of their stock
     was brought up the river in a keel boat of forty or fifty
     tons capacity. It was rigged with a large square sail, but
     the principal power was men with poles, who shoved it
     against the current. They had loaded it with pork and sent
     it down the river in the spring.

     "In 1851 occurred the great flood. Most of the lower parts
     of the town were under water. The grand lodge met that year
     at Ft. Madison, and at the time the river was at its highest
     point. We were cut off from all the neighboring country by
     the swollen streams, but the lodge thought it must be
     represented and I was chosen as the delegate. N. B. Brown
     suggested that I should go down the river in a skiff to a
     point opposite Muscatine, then by land to that place, which
     is only ten or twelve miles distant, then by steamer to Ft.
     Madison. The lodge furnished the skiff. I found a companion.
     We embarked in the morning and so swift was the current that
     we reached our destination by nightfall, and I was on time
     for the meeting. At the meeting I renewed my acquaintance
     with the grand master and the grand secretary, and met many
     brethren who became lifelong friends.

     "In the spring of 1852 a steamboat came to Cedar Rapids. It
     was a great event, and brought in people from near and far.
     She brought a full cargo of freight, among which was the
     household effects of Mr. Bever and my father, both of whom
     from that time forward became citizens of the town. This
     year also came Mr. Daniel O. Finch with a printing press and
     forthwith started the _Progressive Era_, the first paper in
     the Cedar valley. Ezra Van Metre, a talented young lawyer
     from Cincinnati, Ohio, also came that year. Every one was
     rejoiced that we had an organ and the editor was overwhelmed
     with original matter. There were at least a dozen young
     fellows in the town, myself among the rest, who thought they
     'knew it all,' and anxiously rushed into print. The paper
     changed hands in a year or two, and became the _Cedar Valley
     Times_ and continued until a few years ago.

     "In the winter of 1852 I had a serious time in a
     professional way. A young man living at Quasqueton, Buchanan
     county, was riding across the prairie near that place and
     met a bear. The bear fled and he pursued. In crossing a
     strip of ice the horse fell. He was thrown and his foot
     stuck in the stirrup and he was dragged four miles over the
     snow, which was about six inches deep. In the mad flight the
     horse kicked and broke his right leg below the knee in two
     places. Finally the saddle turned, his foot was released and
     he was dropped on the lone prairie. The horse found his way
     home with saddle under his belly. This was on the evening of
     the 17th of December. A search was organized, but he was not
     found till the 21st, four days after the accident.
     Fortunately the weather was not as cold as it sometimes
     gets, but his hands and feet were badly frozen. Cedar
     Rapids, about thirty-five miles distant, was the nearest
     point where doctors could be found. I was sent for and went
     by the way of Marion, and took with me Dr. Thomas Bardwell,
     who was then a student in Dr. Ristine's office. There was a
     road to Center Point. There we struck across the prairie to
     Quasqueton, eighteen miles distant, without a house. We
     reached there the evening of the 23d, nearly frozen
     ourselves, for the weather was bitterly cold. They had got
     the young man thawed out, but in a most miserable condition.
     Mortification had set in, and there was no chance for the
     broken leg. Immediate amputation was the only hope, but I
     had no instrument but a small pocket case, and delay would
     be fatal. Necessity is the mother of invention. A butcher
     had just come to the place and had his tools. He sharpened
     his knives and filed his saw. A strong handkerchief was
     twisted, a knot made in the middle, which was placed over
     the main artery. It was tied tightly and a strong stick
     thrust under it and twisted till the circulation was shut
     off. Then with the butcher's tool I amputated the thigh four
     inches above the knee. Dr. Bardwell administered chloroform,
     which fortunately we had taken with us, and he encouraged me
     by word and deed. The young fellow, who was about 21, had
     never been sick a day in his life, rallied well and improved
     for about a week, but the other leg, which we hoped to save,
     began to mortify and there was nothing left but to amputate
     it. In the meantime we heard of a doctor about thirty miles
     away, in the direction of Dubuque, who had a case of
     instruments. I sent to borrow them. He refused to lend them
     but came back with the messenger and insisted, as he owned
     the instruments, he should perform the operation. That was
     not professional, but as I thought the patient had not more
     than one chance in ten to recover, I was not unwilling to
     divide the responsibility; so he amputated the other leg
     below the knee. During that winter I made eight trips
     between Cedar Rapids and Quasqueton on horseback, and the
     fellow recovered. He was the son of a well-to-do farmer in
     Harrison county, Ohio. His father came out in the spring,
     stole his son away without paying the doctors or the man in
     whose house he had been during recovery, and to carry
     ingratitude still further he procured a Methodist preacher
     to write his life, in which I was depicted as an ignorant
     butcher. This book he peddled about Ohio in person. I
     confess that when I heard he had been sent to the
     penitentiary for committing an aggravated rape I was not
     very sorry. This experience rather disgusted me with the
     practice of medicine in a new country. I was, however, in a
     way compensated, for I sent a history of the case to the New
     York _Tribune_, and its publication gave me quite a
     reputation as a fearless surgeon and thereafter I was called
     when surgery was required. As I have said before, I was in
     the habit of showing strangers about the country who wanted
     to buy land. In that way I became familiar with choice lots
     of vacant land. Greene and Weare dealt in land warrants,
     which they sold on a credit at three per cent per month
     interest. I knew of a section of land in the Iowa river
     bottom that I thought I should be able to sell. I borrowed
     the land warrants, entered the section and in less than two
     months had sold it for $3 per acre cash. That settled the
     matter. By one transaction I had made more than I had done
     in any year's practice. I sold out my medicines to Dr.
     Koontz and thenceforth till the war had nothing to do with
     medicine.

     "About 1853-4 we began to lose confidence in the 'Ram's
     Horn' railroad project. Congress had made grants of land to
     aid railroad projects and public opinion seemed to favor
     east and west rather than north and south lines. Roads from
     Chicago were approaching the Mississippi river, and a line
     from Rock Island to Council Bluffs was projected. The people
     in the tier of counties north of the projected line became
     stirred up and a railroad convention was called to meet in
     Maquoketa, Jackson county, to organize a company to build a
     line in their interest. Cedar Rapids sent a delegation as
     follows: George Greene, N. B. Brown, Daniel Lothian, I. N.
     Whittam, Donald McIntosh, Ezra Van Metre, and myself. Marion
     also sent a large delegation and the counties along the line
     were well represented. A company was organized to build a
     line from Savanna on the Mississippi river to a point on the
     Missouri river not named. A corps of surveyors was put in
     the field and for two or three years it was the favorite
     project of Cedar Rapids. The settlements both in town and
     country were increasing rapidly and we suffered greatly for
     lack of transportation. Judge Greene, with his usual energy
     and public spirit, organized a steamboat company in which
     the prominent citizens became stockholders. This was in the
     winter. The judge went to Pittsburg, contracted for a boat
     suitable for our river, which by spring was completed and at
     the opening of navigation made her first trip, well
     freighted with all kinds of goods for our own merchants, and
     those of the surrounding towns. She was kept in commission
     for two or three years and was a great benefit to the
     community. The company hired a captain and various
     stockholders were at different times supercargo. While H. G.
     Angle was acting in that capacity she collided with and sunk
     another boat on the Mississippi, which led to a law suit in
     which our company had to pay large damages, which swept away
     all our profits. She made her last trip under my charge, and
     under direction of the company I sold her to parties in St.
     Louis. By this time a great rivalry had grown up between our
     town and Marion. Cedar Rapids claimed that she was to be the
     commercial metropolis and therefore ought to be the
     political center. The question was brought to an issue by
     the county commissioners ordering a new court house at
     Marion, subject to the approval of the voters of the county.
     Cedar Rapids opposed the measure, believing that the
     building would insure the permanent location of the county
     seat. Then ensued a most bitter canvass. The voters were
     deluged with oratory. Marion put on the stump Judge Isbell,
     I. M. Preston, Col. Wm. Smythe, N. M. Hubbard, W. G.
     Thompson, and R. D. Stephens, against whom Cedar Rapids
     opposed Jas. J. Child, Ezra Van Metre, Donald McIntosh, A.
     S. Belt, E. N. Bates, I. N. Whittam, and others. Every
     school district was canvassed and much bitter feeling
     engendered. The Marion people were more adroit politicians
     and carried the election, but the result did not discourage
     our citizens, who asserted that no election could affect
     'manifest destiny.'

     "About 1852 Major J. M. May came to Cedar Rapids from
     Janesville, Wisconsin. The major was a stirring man with a
     head full of schemes. He said that Cedar Rapids was a place
     of immense possibilities and only wanted enterprise to make
     it the great town of Iowa. He bought land at the lower part
     of town adjoining that owned by my father, and land on the
     west side adjoining the river and below that owned by Dr.
     King. He platted out town lots on both sides of the river,
     and induced my father and King to do the same, which were
     the first additions made to the original town. He also
     surveyed the island, sent a plat to the general government
     and took possession of it, much to the chagrin and surprise
     of the old settlers. Then he began to agitate the question
     of a free bridge. Every one wanted a free bridge but were
     undecided as to the location. The major induced my father to
     subscribe $1,500, and he gave $1,000, which with sums
     contributed by others in the lower end of the town, secured
     the location below the island at the narrowest place in the
     river. The bridge was completed and thrown open to the
     public, I think, in the late fall of 1852, and proved a
     great convenience. The construction was defective and when
     the ice broke up in the spring, the heavy cakes knocked down
     two of the piers, and destroyed the greater part of the
     bridge. All the people of the town were collected on the
     bank of the river watching the event, and two young women
     who were crossing went down with the structure and were
     drowned. This was the first bridge built at Cedar Rapids.
     The next was a bridge of boats at the foot of Iowa avenue
     which I believe was also swept away by ice. About this time
     the Rev. Williston Jones, who officiated in the 'Muddy,' and
     was a very good as well as energetic man, went east on some
     missionary effort. While there he met a gentleman named Coe,
     who made a donation of land adjoining the town plat for
     educational purposes providing the people would also
     contribute. A meeting was called and the terms complied with
     and thus Coe college was founded. I was quite honored when
     with others I was named as a trustee. Not long after this
     time the Reverend Starr became rector of the Episcopal
     church, and under the lead of Judge Greene and Mr. Bever,
     they began the erection of the first Episcopal church, and
     about the same time the Methodists built a brick church, so
     you see Cedar Rapids began to get on 'praying grounds and
     interceding terms.' In the winter of 1856-7 we were
     surprised and flattered by receiving a communication from a
     party of railroad men connected with the North-Western
     railroad, then completed to Fulton, Illinois, asking us to
     join them and organize a railroad company from Clinton on
     the west side of the Mississippi river to our town. This was
     a new proposition, and we had never heard of Clinton, which
     in point of fact was only a cornfield staked out in town
     lots, besides we were committed to the line that was to run
     west from Savanna. We consulted with the Marion people, but
     they would have nothing to do with it, arguing that we had
     already applied for the land grant for the Savanna route.
     After serious deliberation and with considerable misgivings,
     we decided to send a delegation to spy out the land and be
     governed by circumstances. John Weare and H. G. Angle were
     chosen as our representatives. It took them three days to
     drive to Lyons which was the nearest town to Clinton, the
     proposed starting point. That was the first time any of our
     citizens had come in contact with real capitalists, men who
     built railroads. There they met a party of men from Boston,
     from Maine, from New York, and Chicago, among whom was
     Charles Walker of Chicago, then president of the
     North-Western. Our deputations were swept from their old
     moorings and immediately joined hands with these men and
     formed a company, the 'Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska,' to build
     west from Clinton, by the way of Cedar Rapids to the
     Missouri river. Cedar Rapids was given first directors as
     follows: Geo. Greene, John Weare, H. G. Angle, S. C. Bever,
     and S. D. Carpenter, which positions we held till the road
     was built to Cedar Rapids. This new departure on the part of
     Cedar Rapids intensified the feeling of rivalry between her
     and Marion; a direct line between Clinton and Cedar Rapids
     would leave Marion off the route, besides the natural
     obstacles were less from Mount Vernon to the river and
     thence to Cedar Rapids. The Marionites denounced us as
     traitors to the original scheme, with a malignant intent to
     leave them out in the cold. We denied the 'allegation and
     defied the alligators.'

     "We said there was nothing behind the old project, but that
     ours was a live scheme, with experienced men with bags of
     money to put it through. Our deputies had pledged $200,000
     from Cedar Rapids, which we proceeded to raise, $100,000 by
     private subscription and $100,000 by city bonds. Greene &
     Weare, then bankers, subscribed $10,000; George Greene,
     $5,000; John Weare, $5,000; N. B. Brown, $5,000; S. C.
     Bever, $5,000; Gabriel Carpenter, $5,000, and numerous
     others smaller sums to make up the amount. Then a city
     election was had and the $100,000 voted by an overwhelming
     majority. Surveys of the route were begun at once and from
     Mount Vernon and Cedar Rapids, two lines were seen; one by
     the way of Marion, and the other by the river. It was
     ascertained that the latter route would be shorter and
     cheaper by $100,000 than the former, but the company
     proposed to adopt the Marion route if she would subscribe
     $100,000, which she declined to do, and the river line was
     chosen. Work progressed slowly and the first year found the
     rails no further west than De Witt, Clinton county. Nothing
     had been done on the Savanna line.

     "Meantime the legislature for 1857-8 assembled, and we were
     astounded to learn that they had passed a bill giving a land
     grant to that company. I do not remember why we had not
     looked after our interests, but only know that we were taken
     by surprise. We thought our enterprise in great jeopardy,
     and resolved to compromise, if possible, with Marion. I
     think that Judge Isbell was then president of the Savanna
     company. Major May, who had favored the Marion line, for
     what reason I now forget, and myself from a warm personal
     friendship with Judge Isbell, were chosen ambassadors. We
     met the judge and the Marion directors of the rival line.
     They were courteous, but obdurate. They said we had deserted
     them and run after strange gods, and now that the tables
     were turned, they proposed to build the road straight west,
     crossing the river eight miles north of Cedar Rapids, and
     instead of their building a branch to Cedar Rapids, we if we
     chose might build the branch from Cedar Rapids, and thus we
     left them, sad and discouraged. 'Whom the gods would destroy
     they first make mad,' and thus it turned out with the
     Savanna route. The company was composed entirely of Iowa
     men, directors from the various county seats and towns along
     the line. Very soon after obtaining the grant, they got
     together and voted each other $25,000 apiece for services
     rendered in obtaining the land grant. As there were about
     twenty of them, the scheme was loaded by about $500,000.
     Then they tried to exploit the enterprise among eastern
     capitalists. But the hard times of 1857-8 were upon us and
     money was scarce both east and west. No one would take hold.
     In the meantime our road was slowly creeping on, and was
     within thirty miles of Cedar Rapids. The grading contract
     was let to John G. Wolf, an experienced railroad builder
     from the east. Most of the money to pay him had to be raised
     among ourselves and pay day was a most serious time. I
     remember upon one occasion, the cash entirely failed, but
     the merchants of the town agreed to honor orders for goods,
     Mr. Bever among the others. Mr. Bever had been a merchant in
     Holmes county, Ohio, and brought his stock of goods from
     there to Cedar Rapids. Among other things he had two or
     three cases of bell crowned silk hats of a very ancient
     date. On pay day our citizens were greatly amused to see our
     streets crowded with Irishmen, all wearing bell crowned
     hats, and as 'fire water' was plenty, before night a great
     many of the hats were caved in. Our Marion friends hearing
     of it said our company was 'busted,' our only assets
     consisting of bell crowned hats. But we persevered and bided
     our time. We called a mass meeting in the city preparatory
     to forming a new company to build the road west from Cedar
     Rapids to the Missouri river, and appointed a committee to
     issue a prospectus to all the counties west of us on the
     proposed line to meet in delegate convention at Cedar
     Rapids. I had the honor of being chairman of that convention
     and as such prepared the paper, and if you will examine the
     file of newspapers of that day you will find a 'Spread
     Eagle' document that I supposed would move the souls of our
     frontier friends. They responded nobly and came on the time
     designated, and we organized the 'Cedar Rapids & Missouri
     Railroad Company,' at least I believe that was the name. L.
     B. Crocker, of New York, was made president, with several
     eastern and western directors, myself among the number. Then
     as the company to whom the legislature had given the grant
     of land, had not turned a spadeful of earth, we organized a
     lobby embracing all our directors on the line west of us; L.
     B. Crocker, the president, Major Bodfish, a Maine man, and
     several of our Cedar Rapids directors, myself among the
     others. When the legislature assembled in 1859-60 we invaded
     the capital, and established our headquarters in an old
     hotel near the river, whose name I have forgotten. Major
     Bodfish was the commissary of the body. We had no money to
     expend, but determined to be hospitable. The major laid in a
     barrel of old rye whiskey; as it was before the war, whiskey
     was cheap, also several boxes of cigars. One of our
     strongest henchmen was J. M. Woodbury, a leading man from
     Marshalltown, and with him Peter Hepburn, now an honored
     congressman, then a very stripling, but showing evident
     signs of what was in him. John J. Kasson was then a young
     lawyer in Des Moines, and we secured him as our attorney.
     Our opponents were not asleep, but were on hand from Marion,
     east to the Mississippi river, with Platt Smith, a
     distinguished member of the bar at Dubuque, as their lawyer.
     Then the fight began, in and out of the state house.
     Speeches were made by our adherents in both branches, and we
     buttonholed and dragged to our headquarters all thirsty
     souls, as well as those who indulged in the milder
     stimulant. Our strong argument was, that our opponents had
     done nothing after having the grant for two years, while we
     had about completed eighty miles of road without help; that
     we only asked for the grant to apply to the line west of
     Cedar Rapids, while they would use it for the line from the
     Mississippi, and that we would be able to accommodate the
     people with a finished road at least two years before they
     could. The law makers were not in a hurry, but towards the
     last of the session they passed our bill, and you may be
     sure there was great rejoicing in Cedar Rapids. On our
     return the citizens gave us a grand banquet in Greene's
     hotel, and we felt that we had at last secured a substantial
     victory for our city, as in fact it was, for thenceforward
     Marion could no longer be our rival. The cars came to Cedar
     Rapids in the summer of 1859, just ten years after we had
     held our first railroad meeting, and we felt at last that
     hope had ended in fruition. An immense concourse greeted
     their arrival from all parts of the surrounding country.
     General D. N. Sprague, then mayor, welcomed the guests, and
     the citizens threw open hospitable doors to all comers."

From 1840 to 1846 much work was going on in the thriving little town.
Glass had already a small grist mill on McCloud's Run and a saw mill
had been started on Indian creek which furnished lumber till the saw
mill on the Cedar river was completed. The labor on the dam was a big
undertaking and took much time as the enterprising adventurers were not
well prepared to cope with so large an undertaking.

Many settlers were coming constantly, all of them full of courage and
pleased with the location, which all proclaimed could not be improved
upon. There were Alexander Ely, Joseph Greene, Homer Bishop, P. W.
Earle, John Vardy, D. Fiddlar, A. Eddy, George Westlake, William Dwyer,
James Gunning, Charles Mulford, Isaac Cook, John Shearer, James Lewis,
Dr. S. M. Brice, and many others.

Churches were also organized, such as the Methodist, in 1841, by Rev.
Hodges, and the Baptist the same year by Rev. G. E. Eberhart. The
United Presbyterian church was organized by John Cunningham ten years
later. New settlers came and other church organizations were completed
and small church buildings were erected by the members.

The following chatty reminiscences of pioneer times is from the
_Republican_ of recent date:

     "'If two of us wanted to lunch together,' he said, 'we went
     to a saloon and sat down over some black bread and a little
     beer. Now you must stand up to drink your beer, and you may
     eat nothing.'

     "In the old days the city and the county politicians met
     here and talked over the political situation. The
     professional men met on equal grounds. Now it is all
     changed.

     "There were some interesting places in Cedar Rapids in those
     old days. In the location where Mr. Armstrong is now about
     to erect a fine business block there was an old German named
     Moritz Hoffbeck. It was a sand hill then, but there was a
     good cellar where Hoffbeck sold beer, gave away good lunches
     and entertained the crowd. His good wife also served the
     guests with good things to eat, cooked after her own
     fashion. Here congregated the best business men of the town
     after the day's business was over. They went home in the
     best of spirits, but often it was rather late when they
     went.

     "Some of the city's poets of that day composed a little poem
     about Moritz which ran as follows:

         "Moritz Hoffbeck is my name,
           Bavaria is my nation.
         Cedar Rapids I dearly love,
           For here I get my ration.

     "Another German, Sam Leunch, kept a place at Third avenue
     and First street, which was for many years a meeting place
     for farmers as well as city men. It also had a reputation
     for its fine lunches.

     "Sych's place was on the present location of the Y. M. C. A.
     This also was German and German dishes were one of its great
     attractions.

     "Frank Simon had a restaurant where Stark's hotel is now
     located. It was an eating house; also a drinking house. It
     was noted in five counties for being the place to get the
     best oysters in any style. The German fries have never been
     excelled. When Simon died, Ben Springer married his widow.
     He retired many years ago and sold the business to the
     Starks.

     "Frank Mark was a Swede who kept a saloon where Denecke's
     store is located, fronting on Second avenue. It was a small
     place but it was always full for he served eatables and kept
     private rooms for his city patrons who wished a quiet place
     in which to talk things over.

     "Pollack's where Severa's store is now located, was the
     Bohemian restaurant much sought for its good things to eat
     and for the imported drinks which he kept for his best
     friends.

     "Count Boshon kept a saloon down into prohibition times and
     ran many saloons in various places. He was known as the King
     of Bohemia and acted as though he might have been a count.
     He imported the Philip Best beer from Milwaukee and stored a
     car or two at a time in ice, and for this he obtained a
     great reputation. Count Boshon was a chancellor and knew how
     to secure the good will of prominent persons of the city and
     of the county officials. He seemed to stand in with all. It
     is said in his favor that while he may have violated the law
     in some instance he tried to keep a decent place.

     "The young business men would take a Saturday off and go up
     fishing or hunting or hire Elias Doty and his boat, the
     'Climax,' and take a sail on the murky waters on the Red
     Cedar, sometimes up, and now and then when the water was
     high, down stream. Now all has changed.

     "In the olden times there were dances at the neighbors or
     other old gatherings. All were common. No dress suits were
     seen and there was no delay on account of lack of any
     introduction.

     "Doctors would get together and tell stories, lawyers would
     joke over their trials in court and in every way people were
     on an equality and truly happy.

     "Then people did not devote all their time to making money.
     They did not spend all the time in business. Young and old
     had a better time of it, for they worked and played as well.
     They were really content with the surroundings and with
     their condition in life.

     "In winter time people got together and had a good time,
     going skating or sleighing--on Christmas there were not so
     many gifts as now, but what was given was with the best of
     feeling. Another thing we have lost, and that is, the New
     Year's day calls. Old and young, married and single, made
     calls on this day every year.

     "It was a fine custom and it ought not to have been dropped.
     Now people are too busy to call on their neighbors and they
     seem to fear that society would not approve of it. In the
     olden days no questions were asked about one's grandfather."

The old founders of Cedar Rapids were strong men in many ways. They
were real live wires, and frequently spent money and devoted much of
their time to exploit new industries. Such men as Geo. Greene, N. B.
Brown, David King, S. D. Carpenter, W. B. Mack, R. C. Rock, P. W.
Earle, H. G. Angle, J. E. Sanford, the Daniels family, the Ely family,
the Weare family, the Bever family, and many others were men of rare
intelligence, aggressive, enterprising, and wide awake, who came here
to make a city at all hazards. They were true as steel to their
convictions, enthusiastic in booming their town, and the "balance
wheels" in time of need which kept things going. Even when some of
these men lost heavily in the unfortunate steamboat ventures, in
railroad exploitations, in bridges, dams, factory properties, and in
other ways, they never complained, although at times it made them "men
of sorrow and acquainted with grief." They never lost courage, and
expected things to turn, even when they looked the darkest, and won in
the end. The early pioneers were men keen to see an opportunity. They
were able to look ahead, and for this reason they perhaps hung on when
times were hard and when enterprises failed to materialize. It was due
to the enthusiastic spirit of those leading citizens that caused the
Legare and Bryan families to invest $80,000 in gold in Linn county
property. It was no doubt due to the up-to-date, progressive spirit of
those citizens that led S. C. Bever to bring $30,000 in gold, which was
invested mostly in city property in Cedar Rapids in the early '50s. It
was no doubt due to the keenness of mind of the late Judge Greene, that
John T. Waterhouse in an early day came to Cedar Rapids and invested
much money in choice corner lots on which he erected, for that time,
modern business blocks. But outside of a few men, most of the early
pioneers came to the county without any means. These acquired in the
course of a few years, large holdings which have since doubled in value
several times. Few, if any, who invested in real estate in Cedar Rapids
and Linn county in an early day and who had foresight enough to hold on
to it, ever lost anything on such investments. Values have gradually
increased until corner lots which sold for $10 in the early '40s in
Cedar Rapids, have now a value of from $2,000 to $10,000, and lands in
and around the city which were disposed of at $5 to $10 an acre, have
sold at from $250 to $500 an acre, and even higher.

The settlement in Linn county was an event of more or less importance,
for it was the last stand of the "free booters," and the last rush for
cheap land in the Mississippi valley. The citizens came at an opportune
time and took up the cheap lands, which soon rose in value. While
during the panic of 1857, many of the farmers were unable to pay taxes
on their farms and the value of farm produce was very low, yet they
managed to get through. The panic of 1873 was not so disastrous on the
farmers of Iowa, because by that time they had acquired more property
and could afford to hold their stuff longer than in the panic of 1857.
The land values stood still for awhile, but soon they began to move
again and the farmer who had paid for an eighty-acre strip of land
generally purchased another eighty or two, as he had plenty of help and
the banks were willing to loan him the money. This land has more than
doubled in the past twenty years, but the value of a season's crop now,
as compared to forty years ago, has also more than doubled.

Elias Doty, the son of an old pioneer, contributes the following items
regarding Westport:

     "The first squatter town in Linn county was Westport,
     situated on the east bank of the Cedar river, near a spring
     three-fourths of a mile below the mouth of Indian creek. In
     1845 its buildings consisted of one double log cabin, one
     frame dwelling, one frame storehouse, and one frame grain
     elevator. My father occupied the storehouse as a pottery,
     where he made earthenware. The elevator was owned by Robert
     Holmes and occupied by H. G. Higley and Lawson Daniels, who
     bought wheat and built flatboats to float it to the St.
     Louis market. Our family were the only dwellers at the town
     at that time. Higley and Daniels boarded with us. They built
     their boats bottom up and when completed turned them over.

     "Jacob Leabo lived a half mile below us, and Hiram Deem a
     half mile above us. I. W. Carroll and C. C. Cook lived at
     Dairy Dale, where they had started a brick kiln, which was
     the first in the county so far as I know. The first lime
     kiln was at Westport, where John Henry burned lime to
     plaster the houses of the town. The saw mill of the county
     at that time was near Bertram. It was started by my uncle,
     Elias Doty, who was killed at its raising in 1841. It was
     finished by James Briney."


EARLY HOTELS IN CEDAR RAPIDS

While the Shepherd Tavern was the first place where strangers could be
entertained in Cedar Rapids, it was not long till several hotels were
started. "It has always been a hotel town," said an old settler, "for
the reason that when people came here they liked it so well that they
did not care to move and they stayed at the tavern as long as money and
credit held out."

John Young, who held a claim near Shepherd, erected a small house on
Fourth avenue close to the river, which became known as the "Astor
House." This was a double log house, 18x26, and one story high,
according to the testimony of Robert Ellis, George R. Carroll, and
others. This building had several additions built to it during the next
five years. A Mr. Verbeck, a native of Vermont, was one of the early
landlords. This house was occupied by J. L. Shearer, John Weare, James
Hamilton, and several other well known pioneer families. The
Listebargers kept a sort of hotel near the Sinclair ice houses in
1839-40, and here Robert Ellis and several other unmarried men boarded.
The Listebargers did not keep strangers, only regular boarders.

Wm. Dwyer erected a real up-to-date hotel in 1847, as it was said there
was a demand for such a building. It received the name of the Union
House, with Jas. Gunning as the first landlord. It was located on Third
avenue and Third street, near the present site of the Montrose Hotel.
It was well spoken of and much patronized. The building was destroyed
by fire in 1865. The American House and Greene's Hotel, both on First
street, were well known places, sought by the traveling public.
Greene's Hotel was for years one of the leading hotels in Iowa, a
four-story building on the corner of First avenue and First street
where political rallies were held and banquets were served, and where
balls occurred during the winter seasons.

The old Southern or Brown's Hotel was for many years one of the leading
hotels. It is still operated under the name of Gorman's Hotel. The old
Empire House was another hotel which in the early fifties was a place
much frequented by the commercial traveler. It stood on the corner of
Third avenue and Second street. Johnson's Hotel, on the west side,
formerly Kingston Hotel, was also a well known place of entertainment.
On the site of what is now the Cedar Rapids House there was operated
for many years a popular little hotel which was always full to
overflowing. One of the old clerks here used to reply to the fellow who
asked if they were full, "The clerk is, but the house never, come in."
Many of the pioneer travelers, who wanted to cross Dave King's ferry,
came to stay over night at this place. The river traffic increased
hotel trade, so did the gold craze in California, but in 1859, when the
railroads reached Cedar Rapids, every other home was turned into a
rooming house to accommodate the traveling public.

The Grand, the Clifton, Palace Hotel, the Pullman, were for years busy
places, till the Delevan, the Allison, and the Montrose were built.

A city is largely known by its hotels, as the word is generally passed
along by the traveling men. Cedar Rapids stands well in the state as a
hotel center.

In the Wolfe Directory for 1868 the following hotels are given Cedar
Rapids: American House, G. E. Cheny; Chicago House, Nick Pitting;
Dubuque House, Anton Christle; Eagle Hotel, R. E. Baldwin; Empire
House, J. L. Peak; Valley City House, Harvey & Sherund; Kingston Hotel,
William Friis; Dubuque House; National Hotel, Humphrey & Bean.

BUSINESS IN 1856

From 1850 to 1860 Cedar Rapids had a marvelous growth, despite the
panic of 1857 which wiped out some of the fortunes of those who had
invested heavily in wild lands and who had engaged in banking. The
_Voice of Iowa_, a local newspaper, has the following to say of the
wealth of the city's business enterprises:

     Flouring mills, four; planing mills, sash, doors and blinds,
     two; cooper, one; wagon and carriage factories, five; iron
     foundry, one; cabinet and chair factories, two; plow
     factories, three; boot and shoe factories, three; saddle and
     harness factories, three; tin, copper and sheet iron
     workers, four; woolen factory, one; brick yards, five; farm
     implement factories, two; merchant tailors, two;
     woodworking, two; newspapers, three; brick machine factory,
     one; grocery and provision stores, eight; dry goods,
     fifteen; clothing, five; drug stores, four; jewelers, two;
     hardware, four; book stores, two; book bindery, one; liquor
     and cigars, six; public halls, five; hotels, five; churches,
     four; lumber yards, four; bakery, one; banks, three; barber,
     one; public reading room, one. The same issue of the paper
     cites that the town should have a pork packing plant as well
     as a paper mill. It took a long time before the T. M.
     Sinclair Company's plant became an assured reality, which
     has become in time such a factor in the upbuilding of Cedar
     Rapids and Linn county.

As yet, however, the improvements were confined to but a small portion
of the present city. Iowa (First) avenue had been used as a sand bank,
at the convenience of builders, and being left in ridges and hollows
was impassable to teams. Lot owners on Eagle street (Second avenue)
were urged to cut out the underbrush in the street so that wagons might
pass, and thus that section of the city become attractive for
residences.

From "Historical Sketch of the City," in the _Cedar Rapids Directory
for 1870-71_, we cull the following:

     "During the year 1838 the first land claim was made by a
     certain Wm. Stone on what constituted the present site of
     Cedar Rapids. This was not the first claim made, however, as
     John Mann, Esq., had the honor of being the first settler in
     the county, having located at Pine Grove in the early part
     of the same year.

     "The attention of the early pioneers being drawn to the
     manufacturing resources of the county, the present site was
     early chosen as most suitable for a city, as the swift
     current of the river at this place would afford, in all
     probability, a valuable and extensive water-power. In 1841
     the town was laid out, and within a short time thereafter
     the improvement of the water-power was commenced. The land
     lying along the margin of the river and commanding the
     water privileges was soon purchased by Messrs. N. B. Brown,
     George Greene, H. W. Gray, and others, who early commenced
     the construction of the dam and the building of those mills
     and manufactories which have since been the pride of the
     city and which have contributed so much to its permanent
     growth and development.

       *       *       *       *       *

     "N. B. Brown, Esq., has added an attractive feature to the
     city by erecting a costly and elegant hotel on North
     Commercial street, which, when finished, will be one of the
     finest west of Chicago. In addition to these, the building
     of the mammoth machine shops of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids
     and Minnesota R. R. Company is shortly contemplated. This
     will involve an expense of several hundred thousand dollars,
     for which purpose fifty thousand dollars have been
     appropriated to the company by this city and township.

     "... As to educational interests Cedar Rapids has maintained
     a high position among her sister cities of the state. It is
     generally conceded that Iowa is the banner state of the
     Union, regarding her system of free schools and the
     advantages derived therefrom. This city has no less than
     thirty-five thousand dollars in school buildings, including
     the one recently built in West Cedar Rapids. The schools are
     classified and graded under the latest improved system, and
     are presided over by an able corps of teachers, chosen with
     special reference to their attainments and adaptation to
     impart instruction. James E. Harlan has at present the
     entire superintendence of the schools, and by his efficiency
     he is maintaining the high reputation which the schools have
     before sustained. Over thirteen hundred pupils are in
     constant attendance, and the number is yearly increasing.

     "... The Young Men's Christian Association deserves even
     more than a passing notice. The rooms of the Association are
     in Mansfield's Block, over the postoffice, and are opened
     each morning and evening through the week.

     "... The Young Men's Library Association is also a pleasant
     feature of the city. The enterprise has established a choice
     and well selected library, consisting of historic,
     scientific, poetic and biographic works, chosen from the
     best authors in the land. The library rooms are in charge of
     Miss Mary Thompson, a lady of rare grace and culture, who
     takes delight in entertaining her guests and exhibiting the
     many works of interest that adorn the shelves of her
     library.

     "... The social, moral and religious elements blend here in
     sweet harmony, and much of the refinement and culture
     witnessed in eastern cities and in eastern society is
     equally exhibited here; hence to those wishing to settle in
     a place combining the advantages of church, schools and
     refined society, as well as a place of good business
     facilities will find Cedar Rapids a desirable city in which
     to locate. We venture the assertion that Cedar Rapids, in
     the future as in the past, is destined to excel, in wealth
     and numbers, her neighboring rivals, and evermore sit as
     queen in the rich valley she so beautifully adorns."

The following obituary appeared in the Cedar Rapids _Gazette_ in March,
1909, and gives a sketch of a person who had passed through much of
what is now the history of a thriving city, and is for that reason made
part of the history of the county. Mrs. Brown was at her death the
widow of one of the foremost men who ever lived in Cedar Rapids.

     "Susan Emery, daughter of Nathan Emery and Cornelia
     Broadhead, his wife, was born August 19, 1824, at Dingman's
     Ferry, Pike county, Pennsylvania, and died March 4, 1909, at
     Cedar Rapids, Iowa, thus having lived 84 years, 6 months and
     15 days, a period of time much longer than the average
     allotted to mankind. A woman in her younger days of a noble,
     perhaps an imperious presence, strong in mental and physical
     make-up; self-reliant and unswerving in the object sought
     to be attained by her. Strong in likes and dislikes, no
     truer, more loyal friend among mankind than she. She came of
     a long-lived, stubborn warrior race. Through her mother,
     Cornelia Broadhead, she was descended from Daniel Broadhead,
     a Yorkshire Englishman, a captain of Grenadiers, who fought
     for Charles the Second during the civil wars of England, and
     by him was commissioned to serve under Colonel Nicholls in
     the expedition to the new world to wrest New Netherlands
     from the Dutch, that the same might become a new world
     kingdom for James, duke of York, brother to the king.

     "Captain Broadhead was made military governor of a portion
     of New Netherlands, with his headquarters at the old Indian
     town of Wiltwyck, called by the Hollanders Esophus and after
     the English occupation named and is still known as Kingston,
     in the state of New York. Captain Broadhead died in 1670. A
     grandson, Daniel by name, in 1733 migrated through the
     wilderness, down through the Jerseys to the water gap and
     located there. He with his sons refused to be driven out of
     the country and off his possessions by the savages during
     the Indian wars and fought for what they considered their
     own and won out. From this Daniel were descended three
     revolutionary soldiers--General Daniel Broadhead, a noted
     Indian fighter and close friend of George Washington; Luke
     Broadhead, a captain and friend of LaFayette, and Garret
     Broadhead, a captain. John Romeyn Broadhead, the historian,
     was of this family of Broadheads. From this it will be seen
     that Susan Brown came from no mean stock. In her younger
     days she was known to be generous and charitable to any
     worthy poor. Her giving was of the quiet and unostentatious
     kind, and to a considerable extent. This trait of character
     remained with her through her old age. She was a woman of
     strict integrity, spotless purity, and the world and
     community in which she lived was undoubtedly the gainer for
     her having lived in it. In 1852 she was married to her
     kinsman, Nicholas Broadhead Brown (a pioneer of 1840),
     coming immediately with her husband and sister, Mrs. Hannah
     E. Higley, to Cedar Rapids and has remained here
     continuously from that time, thus making her, with possibly
     one or two exceptions, at the time of her death, the oldest
     continuous resident of this city. In laying the foundation
     and the early upbuilding of this city were a number of
     potent and conspicuous men and women, such as George Greene,
     Alexander Ely, Addison Daniels, and others, but none more so
     than Nicholas B. Brown and his wife Susan."

It is entirely proper to make some mention in these pages of Captain
Joshua John Snouffer, who came to Cedar Rapids in 1852 when the city
contained less than 400 people. He too had an intimate knowledge of
what it meant to be a pioneer.

Captain Snouffer was born in Maryland February 24, 1825, and though he
was a loyal citizen of Iowa he never ceased to love his native state,
nor did he ever forget its history, its traditions, and its people. He
entered the Mexican war where he was wounded in the head on the field
of battle on November 9, 1847. This wound troubled him all the
remaining days of his life. At the time he was wounded he was first
sergeant of a company of dragoons, and on several occasions had
commanded a company.

As a member of the firm of W. D. Watrous & Company he was closely
identified with the milling industry of Cedar Rapids. He superintended
the erection of "the brick mill" in 1875. With J. J. Child he was the
joint author of the city's charter. He took an active part in the
building of the Iowa & Nebraska Railroad, now the Northwestern. He was
a prime mover in establishing the water works, and was one of those who
gave the city its first street railway. At various times he was a
member of the city government both as alderman and mayor. He was a
skilled parliamentarian, and an honest man in every sense of the word.


CEDAR RAPIDS TODAY

W. I. Endicott, in _The Saturday Record_, July 10, 1909:

Cedar Rapids has had a civic existence since January 15, 1849, on which
date a town charter was adopted and town officers elected. In 1856, a
new city charter was granted by the legislature and under that charter
the affairs of the city were conducted until April 6, 1908, when the
charter was abandoned and the city went under what is known as the
"Commission Plan." Under the provisions of this law all ward lines and
divisions were abolished and five men--a mayor and four councilmen or
commissioners are elected at large. In the hands of these five men is
placed all responsibility for the appointment of the entire city
official staff and the management of city affairs.

The new plan is working in a most satisfactory manner in Cedar Rapids
and many things are being accomplished under it that were impossible of
accomplishment under the old ward system. The improvements under way
are all planned with a view to actual necessity and the harmonious
building up of the city in all its sections. Modern business methods
are in use in the conduct of the city's affairs and unwise or
extravagant expenditure of the public money is not permitted. The
council meets nearly every day and the citizen who has business to
transact with the council is given instant hearing and attention.

Under the law, the mayor is paid a salary of $2,500 and each of the
councilmen $1,800 annually, and they devote full time and attention to
the work of the city. The city's business is divided into departments
and each man is in charge of and responsible for a certain department.
The mayor is head of the department of Public Affairs and as such,
exercises a general supervision over all phases of the city business.
Then there are the departments of Accounts and Finances, the department
of Public Safety, the department of Streets and Public Improvements,
and the department of Parks and Public Property. The men elected have
first to be successful in a wide open primary and then in the regular
city election secure a majority of all the votes cast. In the election
of 1908 there were 48 candidates for councilman and nine candidates for
mayor on the primary ballot. From these names the two who received the
highest number of votes for mayor and the eight who received the
highest number of votes for councilman were declared the nominees and
their names appeared on the ballot at the regular election, the names
appearing in alphabetical order on both the primary and regular
election ballots, and without any party or other designation.

In 1908 the council accomplished the sale of the old city hall site and
the purchase of May's Island for park and public buildings purposes.
This island has an area of about six acres, and lying in the Cedar
river in the very center of the city, forms an ideal place for a civic
center. The city offices are now occupying temporary quarters on the
island and as rapidly as possible the low places are being filled with
dirt from the various excavations for business buildings, and from
other sources, so that what was once a municipal disgrace, is being
rapidly transformed into a place of beauty, to say nothing of forever
setting at rest any possibility of divisive strife between the two
sides of the river.


THE CITY'S ASSETS

The public improvements of the city of Cedar Rapids represent
expenditures running into the millions of dollars. Few cities of like
size are so thoroughly or excellently paved. On the first of January,
1909, the city had three miles of asphalt, twenty miles of brick, and
five miles of macadam paving, or a total of twenty-eight miles. There
are now under construction, or already completed on contracts carried
over from 1908, two miles of brick and one mile of tar treated macadam,
giving Cedar Rapids at the present time thirty-one miles of paving.
The contracts let for 1909 will add more than five miles to that total,
so the city will have approximately thirty-six miles of paving at the
end of the present year.

Sidewalks are practically all of cement construction and laid under
city supervision. On January 1, 1909, there were more than 102 miles of
walk in the city, and of this more than ninety-six miles were of
cement, nearly four miles of brick or stone and only about two miles of
wooden construction. The contracts let for this season will represent
the construction of about eight miles of walks, giving the city a total
of 110 miles of sidewalks.

Cedar Rapids has two systems of sewers, sanitary and storm water. Some
of the storm water sewers are of large size, being seven feet in
diameter, and one--the Vinton ditch sewer, is even larger.

Cedar Rapids has an excellent fire department, equipped with the best
of apparatus. There are five stations--one central station and four
outlying hose houses.

In the matter of parks the city has made a most promising start. There
are now in the city twenty-eight parks, counting large and small and
not including any street parkways. Of this number Bever Park, Ellis
Park, Daniels Park, May's Island Park, Riverside Park, and Whittam Park
are considerable tracts, while George Greene Square, opposite the union
station, with its beautiful display of flowers and rich green lawn, is
one of the show spots of the city. Bever Park, the largest of the
parks, in the woods to the east of the city, was the gift of James L.
Bever, George W. Bever, and John B. Bever, as a memorial to their
father, Sampson C. Bever, who was one of the pioneers of the city.
Bever Park is flanked one side by picturesque Vernon Heights and on the
other by beautiful Ridgewood, forming an almost continuous park of
great extent and beauty. Daniels Park is the newest of the city parks.
It is located on the Old Marion Road and has been transformed into a
beautiful floral park, with well-arranged walks and driveways.
Riverside Park is the close-in park, being located on the bank of the
river south of Eleventh avenue, and this has been made a play park,
with plenty of out-door gymnasium apparatus for the children and young
people. Ellis Park, located on the river bank above the city, is one of
the most beautiful and attractive of all the parks, and when adequate
means of reaching it are installed, it will without question be one of
the most popular parks in the city. The river with its excellent
boating facilities, gives a charm to Ellis Park that is denied the
other breathing places of the city. The city of Cedar Rapids is
spending more than twenty thousand dollars each year on its park
system, and it is money well spent. There are about two hundred acres
in the park system, and a conservative value of the park grounds and
improvements is well over $300,000.

The Free Public Library is a most valuable asset to the city and aside
from the unmeasurable good done in the dissemination of knowledge,
represents a money investment of well toward $150,000. The building
proper was the gift of Mr. Carnegie and cost $75,000, the grounds and
other items and the contents of the library will add another $75,000 to
the valuation. It is supported by a city tax and costs about $12,000
per year to operate. Its affairs are in charge of a board of trustees,
appointed by the council.

The city owns and maintains five bridges across the Cedar river. Of
these bridges four are of steel construction and one--the Second avenue
bridge--is a magnificent reinforced concrete bridge of Melan arch
design. This bridge is one of the best and most attractive in the
middle west. Its cost was more than $100,000.

[The city contracted in 1909-10 a new concrete bridge to replace the
old steel bridge on Sixteenth avenue at a cost of $80,000. It is 40
feet wide and 2,600 feet long, and was opened for traffic January,
1910. A new concrete bridge will be contracted in 1911 at Third avenue
to replace one of the oldest in the city.]

The city water works are owned by the city of Cedar Rapids, and are
managed by three trustees appointed by the council. The plant was
purchased from the water company July 1, 1903, at an agreed price of
$473,000. Of this amount, $23,000 was paid in cash and the remainder
was put in the form of bonds. In the past six years $158,000 of these
bonds have been retired, leaving a net indebtedness against the water
plant of $315,000. The net earnings of the plant from July 1, 1903, to
July 1, 1908, were $79,952.30, and for the year ending July 1, 1909,
were almost $25,000. In addition the city gets free hydrant rental and
fire protection. A conservative inventory of the water plant will show
a valuation of well over $600,000 at the present time. The water is
taken from large wells on an island in the Cedar river belonging to the
city and located some distance above the C. & N. W. bridge. It is
filtered by the Jewell system and is forced through the mains by large
pumps. There are three of these pumps in use, one of two million
gallons daily capacity, one of three million gallons capacity and one
of five million gallons capacity. The necessary power is supplied by
two water tube boilers of 350 horsepower each, and three tubular
boilers of 70 horsepower each. The filter system has a capacity of
three million gallons per day, and an additional reservoir for the
filter is now under construction. There are at the present time 390
fire hydrants and an excellent and satisfactory fire pressure is
maintained for all fire alarms. A loop of twelve-inch mains encircles
the business district and this loop is supplied by a twenty-inch main
direct from the pumps, giving the business section a fire protection
unexcelled by that of any city in the west.


THE RAILWAYS

Up to 1849 the village of Cedar Rapids had no formal organization. It
was simply a township. But the legislature of 1849 granted a town
charter and for the next decade the community throve apace. It was
during this period of years that Cedar Rapids strove for, and secured,
its first line of railway. In the fifties the railway lines to the west
left the bank of the Mississippi and pushed their way out into the
fertile prairies of Iowa. Among these lines was one known as the
Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska, and its purpose was to construct a line of
railway from Clinton, across Iowa, to some point on the Missouri river.

Among Cedar Rapids men who were prominently identified with the
enterprise and were on the board of directors were John Weare, Jr.,
William Greene, H. G. Angle and S. C. Bever. The company was organized
in 1856, but it was not until June, 1859, that the line was completed
from Clinton to Cedar Rapids, a distance of a little over eighty miles,
and train service established between the two towns.

Previous to the coming of the railroad, communication with the outside
world was maintained by means of stage lines; Dubuque, Clinton,
Davenport, Muscatine, Iowa City, and Waterloo being reached by that
method. Freight and supplies were brought in by wagon, though in the
early days there was some steamboat traffic on the Cedar river as far
as Cedar Rapids.

It required hard work, and plenty of it, to get that first new line of
railway into Cedar Rapids. Marion, the old, substantial town and the
county seat, wanted the road--and came pretty near getting it, too. The
next move in railway construction work for the community was the
extension of the new line west, on its way to the Missouri river, a
line which is today the main artery of the Chicago & Northwestern
system, forming an important part of the great highway of steel
connecting the Atlantic and Pacific.

The original promoters of the Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railway,
living in Cedar Rapids, were anxious that that company should build a
branch line up the Cedar valley from this point, and thus tap the rich
and rapidly growing territory lying to the northwest of Cedar Rapids.
But the company had no time or money with which to build side lines or
branches. Its objective point was the Missouri river and the great
beyond. So Judge George Greene, S. L. Dows, and other prominent public
spirited men took up the task of constructing a road from Cedar Rapids
to Vinton and Waterloo. Burlington capitalists and promoters joined in
the work of extending the line from Cedar Rapids southeast to
Burlington, and in a few years the embryo of what later became the
Burlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern, the "Cedar Rapids route," with its
lines radiating from Cedar Rapids to Clinton, Muscatine, Burlington,
What Cheer, Iowa City, Sioux Falls, Watertown, Worthington, Forest
City, Albert Lea, St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Decorah, was in existence.
The shops, roundhouses and general offices of the road were located in
Cedar Rapids, and everybody took pride and a personal interest in
speaking of the institution as the "Home Road." The absorption of the
Burlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern by the great Rock Island system,
thus giving Cedar Rapids direct connections with all stations on that
road, is a matter so recent as to be hardly history as yet. This change
has been more in name than in reality. The shops are maintained, as in
years past. An even larger army of trainmen and operative employes make
Cedar Rapids their home, and the general offices for the northern
district make use of the general office building constructed by the
Burlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern Railway Co.

Cedar Rapids' third railway enterprise was the securing of the Dubuque
& Southwestern, locally known as the "Slough Shore," from the manner of
its entrance into the town. This railway was built and operated by the
Farleys, father and sons, of Dubuque, and for many years, with its
connection with the Illinois Central at Farley, maintained the only
line of direct communication between Dubuque and Cedar Rapids. In the
early days some very peculiar railroading was done on the Farley line,
and the incidents and happenings, if gathered together, would make an
extended volume.

The Dubuque and Southwestern is now a part of the Chicago, Milwaukee &
St. Paul system, and over its tracks trains now run to Chicago, Omaha,
Kansas City, Minneapolis, and St. Paul, as well as to the original
sleepy little terminus of Farley.

The last steam road to enter Cedar Rapids was the Illinois Central, a
line being constructed from Manchester by the late S. L. Dows. This
line opens up to the shippers and business men of Cedar Rapids direct
connections with the Illinois Central, and is of peculiar value in the
traffic in southern and tropical fruits and commodities which come by
water to New Orleans.

More recently the interurban between Cedar Rapids and Iowa City has
been constructed, and with its hourly service it has won a business
which makes certain the building of other and equally as promising
lines in the near future.

Cedar Rapids of 1909, from a railroad point of view, is the traffic
pivot of the middle west. Centering here are four of the largest
railway systems of the country--the Chicago & Northwestern, the
Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, the Rock Island, and the Illinois
Central. From Cedar Rapids direct lines radiate to Chicago, Peoria, St.
Louis, Kansas City, St. Joseph, Council Bluffs, Omaha, Sioux City,
Sioux Falls, Watertown, Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Milwaukee, the total
mileage of the lines entering Cedar Rapids being about 35,000 miles.
Direct service is maintained between Cedar Rapids and nearly 1,750
stations in Iowa, to say nothing of the thousands of stations in other
and surrounding states reached by direct train service from this city.
More than 225 railway and interurban trains arrive in or depart from
Cedar Rapids daily. Approximately 80,000 carloads of freight are
handled annually. The freight earnings are about $3,500,000 and the
passenger receipts are about $1,200,000 each year. Three express
companies, the American, the United States, and the Wells-Fargo,
maintain offices in Cedar Rapids.

Recognizing the future of Cedar Rapids as a railroad, manufacturing and
distributing center, the railroads have all been expending vast sums of
money in the past few years in the acquisition of property for
terminal purposes. The Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, the Illinois
Central, and the Rock Island now control absolutely the entire section
of the city lying between Fifth and Ninth avenues, the river and Third
street, and it is only fair to presume that the four blocks between
Third and Fourth streets and Fifth and Ninth avenues will also be
devoted exclusively to railway purposes. South of the city, along the
river bank, the Chicago & Northwestern is expending thousands of
dollars in the filling in of a large section of low land and old river
bed, and on this made ground new and enlarged terminals and switch
yards will be built.

The Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific is now engaged in the construction
of its new terminals and freight depot on the blocks lying between
Second and Third streets and Fifth and Ninth avenues, and when
completed these terminals and depot will be ample for the accommodation
of a freight business of a city of hundreds of thousands of population.

In the matter of passenger travel the city is well accommodated in the
two depots, both on Fourth street, one occupied by the Chicago &
Northwestern and the Rock Island, and known as the Union station, and
the other occupied jointly by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul and the
Illinois Central lines.

Mention must also be made of the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City interurban
line, which maintains an excellent hourly service between the two
cities. This line of road is the pioneer in the interurban field for
the city, if the line to Marion be excepted, but is proving daily more
and more popular and its business is increasing in such a measure that
the building of additional lines of like character is only a question
of the near future.


MANUFACTURING

From the days of its very earliest beginnings the people of Cedar
Rapids have paid especial attention to the manufacturing industry. A
large part of those who settled in Cedar Rapids came from the east
where manufacturing leads all other industries and it is but natural
that they should embark in their new home in those lines with which
they were familiar. The papers and records of the early days tell of a
long line of enterprises that have come and gone. There were flour
mills, woolen mills, implement works, engine factories, wagon
factories, oil mills--the list is a long and interesting one to the
delver into local history.

With the coming of the railways, opening up markets for the
manufactured products and affording means of collecting and bringing in
the raw material, the manufacturing side of Cedar Rapids' activities
has grown apace, until today Cedar Rapids, although not the largest of
Iowa cities, leads them all in the amount of manufactured goods
produced. In 1908 the total ran to nearly if not quite $22,000,000, and
the output for 1909 will far exceed that great figure. There are now
nearly 100 manufacturing institutions in Cedar Rapids, employing nearly
4,500 hands and paying more than $3,000,000 annually in wages.

Many of our manufacturing institutions are of many years' standing. The
great mill of the Quaker Oats Company, the largest milling plant in the
world, was originally established years ago as an oat meal mill by
George Douglas and Robert Stuart, two thrifty and persevering Scotchmen
to whose industry and far-sightedness is due the fact that at least the
first course of the world's breakfast (after fruit) comes from Cedar
Rapids. The great packing plant of T. M. Sinclair & Co., Ltd., giving
employment to 1,200 employees and sending its products to all parts of
the world, has done more to advertise Cedar Rapids than any other one
agency. It was established by T. M. Sinclair, a young man from Belfast,
and from its modest beginning many years ago it has become a plant
representing an investment of millions and an ability to supply at
least a large portion of the second course of the world's breakfast.
Then there is the big starch works of Douglas & Co., the largest
independent starch plant in the country--a plant where corn by the
train load is daily transformed into starch and gluten feed. In smaller
institutions note must be made of the Anchor Mill Co. and the T. G.
White Cereal Co., with their specialties in flour and wheat flakes.
While on the subject of cereals, note should be taken of the big
elevators and cleaning houses of the Cedar Rapids Grain Co., the
Clinton Grain Co., Jackson Grain Co., and the Wells-Hord Grain Co.
Without doubt, the name "Cereal City" which has been applied to Cedar
Rapids is not a misnomer.

In other lines Cedar Rapids leads as well as in those involving the
conversion of the native products of agricultural Iowa. This city with
its three great pump companies, the Cedar Rapids Pump Co., the Chandler
Pump Co., and the Iowa Windmill and Pump Co., control the pump,
windmill, iron pipe and plumbing supply business of the middle west.
While the collateral lines covered by the Dearborn Brass Co., the Iowa
Radiator Co., the Tokheim Manufacturing Co., the Vernier Manufacturing
Co., the Smith-Talbott Co., and others add materially to the leadership
of Cedar Rapids in these departments.

The Denning Fence works places Cedar Rapids in a leading position in
the fence manufacturing business. The Perfection Manufacturing Co., the
Hawkeye Skirt and Garment Co., the Welch-Cook Co., and the
Clark-MacDanel Co., give Cedar Rapids a high position in the business
of manufacturing clothing for both men and women that is not suspected,
even by some of the best posted people in the city. Then there are
other lines of manufacture. The J. G. Cherry Co., with their line of
dairy and creamery supplies; the Cedar Rapids Sash and Door Co., the
Williams & Hunting Co., and the Disbrow Sash and Door Co., with their
big wood working plants; the various furniture factories, the cement
and sand-lime brick plants; the big printing plants, for printing is a
most important industry in Cedar Rapids; in short, the list is endless
and as this is not a directory of the manufacturing industries of Cedar
Rapids, further individual mention will have to be abandoned.

What is manufactured in Cedar Rapids? The list is a long and mixed one.
It comprehends all kinds of breakfast foods, flour, starch, gluten
feed, all kinds of packing house products, woven wire fence, candy, ice
cream, pumps, iron pipe, windmills, plumbers' supplies, steam heating
plants, machinery of all kinds, stone and ore crushers, hot air
furnaces, cornices, bank, store and office fixtures, camp and lawn
furniture, corsets, parlor furniture, mattresses, woven wire springs,
undertakers' supplies, egg cases, dairy supplies, butter, concrete
fence posts, sand-lime brick, prepared plaster, ice, gasoline engines,
store step-ladders, hard wood specialties, electrical supplies,
gasoline storage tanks and measuring pumps, manure spreaders, overalls,
women's skirts, suits and jackets, shirts, photo paper, brass goods,
coffee, spices, extracts, baking powder, sash, doors and blinds, steel
baskets, tanks, stoves, school books, umbrellas, vinegar, pickles,
wagons, carriages, omnibuses, automobiles, patent medicines,
physicians' and hospital supplies, crushed stone, cigars, etc., etc.

It is noteworthy that of the many industries started in Cedar Rapids
within the past twenty years, a very large per cent have been financial
successes, some of them notably so. Nearly all of them have been
launched in modest fashion and while nowhere is it possible for all
enterprises to succeed, the few failures in Cedar Rapids have all been
brought about by causes purely individual in the management or because
of circumstances which seemingly no one could control.

Cedar Rapids has passed beyond the experimental stage as a
manufacturing city. It has been demonstrated that industries can be
established and operated successfully here and that goods made in Cedar
Rapids will find a ready and stable sale in all parts of the world. In
fact, Cedar Rapids is but just beginning her epoch of industrial
prosperity and growth and she extends to all the invitation to come,
see how those here are prospering, and join in the march of events
which will in the years to come make Cedar Rapids one of the best
known manufacturing communities in the whole United States.

In this connection it is not amiss to speak of the excellent conditions
which have always surrounded the labor situation in this city. The
manufacturing industry must, of necessity, depend very largely on the
element of labor and in many localities strikes and strife and
misunderstanding and trouble generally have added to the difficulty of
the local situation. There has been but little of this sort of thing in
Cedar Rapids. Labor has always been well paid, well treated and well
satisfied in this city, and the little differences which have come up
between employer and employee have all been settled promptly and
satisfactorily. There has been an absence of the grafting labor
agitator and all have worked harmoniously together to build up the city
and its best interests.


THE STREET RAILWAYS

BY E. A. SHERMAN, EDITOR SATURDAY RECORD

The Marion and Cedar Rapids Improvement Company was incorporated March
8, 1879, to construct street railways on the streets of Cedar Rapids
and Marion, and the highway between, known as the "Boulevard."

The incorporators were Addison Daniels, J. L. Crawford, C. C. Cook, and
John Meredith Davis.

The officers were John Meredith Davis, president; James L. Crawford,
secretary; C. C. Cook, treasurer.

On March 13, 1879, the city council of Marion passed an ordinance
authorizing construction of the line in the city of Marion. On May
16th, the city council of Cedar Rapids passed an ordinance granting the
Marion and Cedar Rapids Improvement Company the right to construct and
operate street railways on Iowa avenue, and also on alternate streets.

October 13, 1879, the name of the company was changed to the Cedar
Rapids and Marion Street Railway Company. John Meredith Davis resigned
as president and was succeeded by W. M. Hewitt.

November 8, 1879, the city of Cedar Rapids passed another ordinance
granting a franchise to the Cedar Rapids and Marion Street Railway
Company for lines on Iowa avenue and on alternate streets. Up to this
last date the enterprise had been fathered by Milwaukee and Davenport
parties, who then dropped out. Construction had already been begun and
the work was continued by Marion parties, prominent among whom were Mr.
E. Latham, J. L. Crawford, and J. C. Davis. Mr. Latham advanced the
money necessary for construction.

On January 8, 1880, Mr. Latham was made president of the company. In
March of that year Judge George Greene (always foremost in any
enterprise which would help Cedar Rapids) took a controlling interest
in the company, and from that time forward, with the financial
assistance rendered by Judge Greene, the work went rapidly on so that
the line began carrying passengers between Cedar Rapids and Marion on
the 3d of May, 1880, by steam motor between Twelfth street in Cedar
Rapids and the terminal station in Marion, and from Twelfth street to
Fourth street in Cedar Rapids in horse cars.

Both Judge Greene and Mr. Latham died early in the summer of 1880, and
although Mr. S. C. Bever, Mr. A. J. McKean and other prominent citizens
of Cedar Rapids and Marion afterwards became interested in the
enterprise, the Greene family always held a controlling interest and
were foremost in management of the company up to the sale in 1890.

Mr. Latham was succeeded as president by William Greene on July 15,
1880.

The board of supervisors forbade the company laying its track on the
boulevard, and brought suit to enjoin such construction. The Eighteenth
General Assembly (1880) passed an act authorizing street railway
tracks on roads 100 feet wide. So the supreme court sustained Judge
Shane in refusing the injunction. Early in the spring of 1881, the line
was extended across the steam railway tracks at Fourth street to the
foot of Iowa avenue. Soon after that date the company were not allowed
to bring the steam motors below Fifteenth street, the horse cars
carrying the Marion passengers up to that point.

The track between Marion and the city limits of Cedar Rapids were laid
with "T" rails weighing sixteen pounds to the yard; afterwards changed
to thirty-five pounds per yard. The horse car tracks were laid with
flat rails weighing twenty-two to twenty-four pounds per yard, spiked
on the top of wooden stringers. The first equipment consisted of two
small second hand steam motors and four cars.

The extensions and additions made were: In 1882, track to fair ground
from First to B avenue, only operated during fairs and amusements. Line
on Adams (now Third) street, First avenue to Fourteenth avenue. Opened
September 7, 1882. Line from First avenue and Commercial (now First)
street to Third avenue, across Third avenue bridge on Third avenue to
Sixth street west; also line on Third street north from Third avenue to
A avenue, and south to Seventh avenue west. These west side lines began
doing business in the fall of 1882, and early in 1883 car and horse
barns were built at Third avenue and Third street west.

In 1884, line extended from Third street and Seventh avenue west to J.
C. Young's addition at Sixth street and Fifteenth avenue west and
afterwards taken up for want of business.

In 1886, line from First avenue east along Fifth street to Fifth
avenue, up First avenue to Tenth street, thence on Tenth street and
Mount Vernon road to Oak Hill cemetery; opened for business July 4,
1886.

Fair ground line taken up. New line on Sixteenth street from First to E
avenue, built and put in operation November 15, 1886.

As the branch lines of horse railroad within the city of Cedar Rapids
paid no profit, the Marion stockholders stoutly objected to the
earnings of the Marion line being used for the sole benefit of the
people of Cedar Rapids. So the Cedar Rapids and Marion Railway Co., on
the 13th of July, 1889, conveyed to John W. Henderson--for the sum of
one dollar--all of these branch lines excepting the Sixteenth street
line. Mr. Henderson on November 14, 1889, deeded the same to the Cedar
Rapids Street Railway, a company organized for the purpose of operating
these city lines, and for the further construction of other city lines
in Cedar Rapids, of which company C. G. Greene was president, U. C.
Blake, vice-president, W. J. Greene, secretary, and George Greene,
treasurer.

These city lines failed to earn enough to pay operating expenses and
were all conveyed back to the Cedar Rapids and Marion Railway Co. on
February 9, 1891. For the year ending June 30, 1884, the number of
employes of the company was twenty, the annual wages $11,667.44. In
1889 the number of employes averaged twenty-eight and the annual wages
$15,878.00.

During the years 1886 to 1890, the west side lines had been gradually
abandoned, so that on December 1, 1890, there was only remaining the
one on First street and across the Third avenue bridge to Third street,
and thence on Third street southwesterly to Seventh avenue.

The entire equipment at that date consisted of two steam motors, two
28-foot coaches, one open trail car, 20 feet long, one baggage car, one
18-foot, six 12-foot, and eleven 10-foot horse cars, two snow plows,
two flat cars and nineteen horses and mules, with the necessary harness
and fixtures.

In the autumn of 1890 it came to the knowledge of Mr. J. S. Ely that
non-resident parties were investigating the situation with a view of
acquiring the property of the Cedar Rapids and Marion Railway, together
with the city lines then owned by the Cedar Rapids Street Railway. Mr.
Ely believing that it would be best for the interests of the city of
Cedar Rapids that control of the transportation facilities be in the
hands of resident property owners, who would have a greater interest in
a more extensive system and better service, than those seeking merely
financial profit, obtained options on a controlling interest in the
capital stock of both of the companies. After which Mr. Ely and Mr.
Henry V. Ferguson organized a syndicate consisting of Messrs. A. T.
Averill, James L. Bever, Chas. H. Clark, Geo. B. Douglas, Walter D.
Douglas, C. J. Ives, C. Magnus, P. E. Hall, J. S. Ely, and Henry V.
Ferguson, who on December 15, 1890, purchased two-thirds of the entire
capital stock of the two companies (the C. R. & M. Ry. and the C. R.
Street Ry.) buying out all of the old stockholders except Frances R.
Greene, C. G. Greene, S. C. Bever, Geo. W. Bever, and U. C. Blake.
Immediately after this change of control, the stockholders paid in
money enough to clear up all the floating debt of the companies, and
put them on a good financial basis. The stockholders addressed the
following communication to the mayor and city council of Cedar Rapids:

     "To the Honorable Mayor and City Council of the City of
     Cedar Rapids, Iowa:

     "The undersigned stockholders in the Cedar Rapids and Marion
     Railway, and in the Cedar Rapids Street Railway Company,
     respectfully represent to your honorable body that they are
     the absolute owners of all the stock of the corporations,
     and all are resident tax payers in said city, largely
     interested in its general progress and prosperity; that it
     is their purpose and intention to reconstruct, improve and
     extend the properties now operated by the said companies and
     to run the cars on said lines by electric power as soon as
     the necessary authority and the additional rights and
     franchises required are granted, and on the granting of the
     same, we pledge ourselves to take immediate steps toward
     putting on electric service, and to rebuild, maintain and
     operate, and from time to time extend the lines in said city
     to the full extent that ordinary business prudence will
     warrant.

     "We, therefore, petition your honorable body to grant said
     corporations the necessary authority, rights and franchises
     to enable them to enter upon and make the changes and
     improvements above mentioned.

     "P. E. Hall, A. T. Averill, Henry V. Ferguson, C. G. Greene,
     Walter D. Douglas, Jno. S. Ely, Chas. H. Clark, C. J. Ives,
     Jas. L. Bever, G. B. Douglas, C. Magnus, F. R. Greene, Geo.
     W. Bever, S. C. Bever, U. C. Blake.

     "Dated December 31, 1890."

The franchise asked for by these stockholders was for twenty-five
years.

Although the above application was warmly supported by the leading
newspapers of Cedar Rapids, the city council refused the franchise so
asked for, but instead on May 1, 1891, granted to the Thomson-Houston
Electric Co. a franchise for fifty years, for lines covering
substantially the same territory on the east side of the river as that
served by the horse cars, and also for three miles of new lines on the
west side of the river, to be afterwards located.

So these gentlemen who had put up their money to save the city of Cedar
Rapids from non-resident ownership of transportation lines, found their
purpose frustrated and with a fair prospect of losing their entire
investment. Rather than suffer this, a majority decided to acquire this
new franchise at the best price obtainable, and then go ahead with
construction according to its terms. After this decision Mr. Ives and
Mr. Magnus retired from the enterprise and took back their money.
Previously, during the negotiation for the franchise, Mr. S. C. Bever
and Mr. U. C. Blake had sold out. On the organization of the new
company to take over the Thomson-Houston franchise, Mrs. Frances R.
Greene, C. G. Greene and Geo. W. Bever sold their interests to the
remaining stockholders.

Neither the Cedar Rapids and Marion Railway nor the Cedar Rapids Street
Railway ever paid a dividend, so that all of the stockholders who had
invested their money in these enterprises went out with entire loss of
income, and most of them with considerable loss of principal.

J. P. Messer was superintendent from January 1, 1881, to February 22,
1883, when he resigned and was succeeded by Wm. Elsom, who remained
superintendent until after the system had been changed into an electric
railway.


CEDAR RAPIDS AND MARION CITY RAILWAY COMPANY

The Cedar Rapids and Marion City Railway Company was organized May 14,
1891, and immediately thereafter purchased the franchise for electric
railways in Cedar Rapids recently granted to the Thomson-Houston
Electric Co., and also took over all the rights, property and
franchises of the Cedar Rapids and Marion Railway. A franchise for
twenty-five years for an electric line from the terminal point in the
city of Marion to the southwesterly city limits of Marion was granted
to this company at about that time. The first officers were: Jas. L.
Bever, president; Walter D. Douglas, vice-president; Chas. H. Clark,
treasurer; Glenn M. Averill, secretary.

Within a few months Jas. L. Bever and A. T. Averill sold out and
retired from the enterprise. After the reorganization resulting from
this change in ownership, the officers were: P. E. Hall, president; W.
D. Douglas, vice-president; Chas. H. Clark, treasurer; John S. Ely,
secretary.

The stockholders were: Chas. H. Clark, Geo. B. Douglas, John S. Ely, J.
S. Cook, Walter D. Douglas, Henry V. Ferguson, and P. E. Hall, of Cedar
Rapids, Horace Williams, of Clinton, Iowa, J. E. Ainsworth, of Council
Bluffs, Iowa, now of Williamstown, Vt., David P. Kimball and L. C.
Kimball, of Boston, Mass., and J. Van Deventer, of Knoxville, Tenn.

No change of ownership except through division of estates of deceased
stockholders has taken place up to the present time.

The work of construction and reconstruction was begun at once and
vigorously pushed during the season of 1891.

All tracks were entirely new excepting from Sixteenth street to Marion.
Those across the First avenue bridge were laid with strap rails, nailed
to the bridge plank. The balance of the double track with 58 pound
girder rails. All other new lines with 45 pound "T" rail. The strap
rail was taken off the bridge and girder rail substituted a few years
thereafter. The city lines on the east side of the river were open for
business in November, 1891, the west side lines in December, 1891, and
electric service begun to Marion in February, 1892.

The main line mileage of the road at this date, not counting spur and
sidetracks is, within the city of Cedar Rapids 12.85 miles, of which
2.28 miles is double track. From the city limits at Kenwood to Marion,
2.80 miles; total 15.65 miles.

The Marion line above Twentieth street through to Marion has been
entirely rebuilt with new rails, the grades cut down, the alignment
changed, the track ballasted, a new steel and concrete bridge built
over Indian creek; so as to make that portion of the road fully
adequate for the business.

Within the last three years all of the girder rail tracks east of the
river have been relaid with 60 and 80 pound "T" rails and the number of
ties increased fifty per cent.

The service has been increased to once in fifteen minutes each way and
extended to twelve o'clock at night on all the lines excepting the
Marion line, where the service is once in twenty minutes during the day
and up to 12:30 a. m.

The power plant first installed consisted of two 125 horsepower engines
connected by belts to two 75 k. w. generators. It now consists of one
400 horsepower engine belted to a 300 k. w. generator, and one 750
horsepower engine directly connected to a 450 k. w. generator. The
output of power is equalized by a storage battery of 272 cells. The
boilers, smoke stack, switch board, condensers and all minor machinery
have been correspondingly increased and improved.

The car barn (originally a wooden iron-clad building 80x140 feet) has
been enlarged and new brick buildings erected with shop room for
building car bodies and trucks, and making all necessary repairs to
cars and electric equipment; so that the present storage shop and
office buildings, with storage for lumber and ties, covers six full
sized city lots. The company now builds its own car trucks and car
bodies.

For the year 1892 (first year of operation of electric lines) the
average number of employes was 81, and the total wages paid $37,610.12.
For the year 1908 the average number of employes was 143 and the annual
wages $84,328.73.

William Elsom was superintendent from the organization of the company
until June, 1892, when he resigned and was succeeded by F. L. Diserens,
who still holds that position.

The present officers and directors are: P. E. Hall, president; Henry V.
Ferguson, vice-president and secretary; John S. Ely, treasurer.

The directors are P. E. Hall, John S. Ely, Henry V. Ferguson, George B.
Douglas, and Edward C. Clark, all of Cedar Rapids; Walter D. Douglas,
of Minneapolis, Minnesota; and David P. Kimball, of Boston,
Massachusetts.


THE COMMERCIAL CLUB

FROM THE SATURDAY RECORD, JULY 10, 1909

The city of Cedar Rapids has had a number of commercial organizations,
formed to advance the business interests of the community, in the sixty
years of its existence, but all the earlier associations were of a more
or less informal character, and while they did good work as long as the
enthusiasm lasted, the time came when each and every one passed into
history. It was not until 1897 that a permanent commercial club came
into being and that organization, which is now known as the Cedar
Rapids Commercial Club, has for the past twelve years played a most
important part in the upbuilding of the city and the promotion of its
best commercial and industrial interests.

The events leading up to the organization of the Commercial Club form
an interesting story, and as the editor of _The Record_ was personally
identified with them, he here takes the liberty of making the facts a
matter of record.

In April, 1897, a meeting of the Fifth District Editorial Association
was held at Excelsior Springs, Mo., and as part of the entertainment, a
delegation from the Commercial Club of Kansas City, escorted the
members of the Editorial Association from Excelsior Springs to Kansas
City and devoted a day to showing them Kansas City from every point of
view. The stock yards, the packing houses, the fire department, the
newspaper offices, the parks were visited, a reception and luncheon
were tendered at the Commercial Club rooms and a dinner was served at
one of the leading hotels. Following the return of the party to
Excelsior Springs, A. N. Palmer, president of the Cedar Rapids Business
College and editor of the _American Penman_, and the editor of _The
Record_ were discussing the splendid entertainment of the Kansas City
boosters and what it meant to a city to have such a live organization;
and it was then and there decided that Cedar Rapids ought to have such
a club. The matter was talked over at length and the result was that as
soon as possible after returning home, Mr. Palmer issued a letter to
some 400 of the business men of the city reciting the need of such an
organization in Cedar Rapids and calling a meeting for the purpose of
considering its formation. That meeting was held in the assembly room
of the Cedar Rapids Business College on the evening of June 8, 1897. It
was decided to form the club and at a subsequent meeting, held July 2d,
the club was formally organized. A. N. Palmer was chosen the first
president and the editor of _The Record_ was elected temporary
secretary, serving until the election of the first permanent paid
secretary, Ed. R. Shaw, who assumed office July 15th. The first offices
of the club were in the Granby building, the rent being a donation from
Mr. E. A. Higley. Subsequently, in May, 1901, came the consolidation of
the Commercial Club with the Occidental Club and the removal to the
Masonic Temple, which has since been the home of the club.

With the consolidation came the addition of the social feature,
including reading room, billiards, and later, the inauguration of the
noon-day lunch, which latter has proved to be most popular, and which
has done much to bring the members in closer touch each with the other.

Ever since organization the Commercial Club has been fortunate in
securing as officers men who have been willing and able to give the
organization their time, best thought and energy, with the result that
it has been and is now a live and potent force in the community. Such
men as Palmer, Anderson, Forbes, Newman, Safely, Rall, and others, have
filled the presidency with credit to themselves and profit to the club
and the city, and in Shaw, Lincoln, Charles, Simmons, Sessions, Shaver,
Bell, and Wunderlich the Commercial Club has had secretaries who have
labored faithfully to further the best interests of the organization
and city. The present officers, J. F. Rall, president, and John
Wunderlich, secretary, are making records in their administration and
achieving results that speak for themselves.

The work of the Commercial Club is so wide-spreading and presents so
many aspects that it is impossible to refer to it in any detail. The
idea of the club is to arrange systematic work to be done by the
members, as well as by the officers, and with that in view, there are a
number of committees in charge of various departments of the work, as
follows: Assembly, Civic, Entertainments, Executive, House, Interurban,
Legislative, Manufactures, Mercantile, Membership, Navigation on Cedar
River, Public Institutions, Trade Extension, Tariff and Transportation,
Special Convention, Railway Service, Statistics. These are all regular
standing committees. In addition, many special committees are appointed
to take up special or emergency matters.

As the result of the labors and aid of the Commercial Club, many
prosperous and valuable manufacturing industries have been brought to
Cedar Rapids the past twelve years. Many local businesses have been
encouraged to start and aided on their way to success. Many established
businesses that have needed encouragement have been given it and other
businesses that have found difficulties in their pathway have had those
difficulties removed through the offices of the Commercial Club and its
members. Conventions and public gatherings of many kinds have been
induced to hold their meetings in this city through work performed by
the Commercial Club. Vexatious local disputes have been adjusted, and
when cities like Indianapolis have attempted to entice such
organizations as the Order of Railway Conductors away from Cedar
Rapids, the Commercial Club has been found stanchly and successfully
contesting the removal. When it was found necessary to secure
legislation amending some phases of the commission plan law to make it
fully applicable to Cedar Rapids, it was the Commercial Club that went
before the legislature and secured the needed amendments. It was the
Commercial Club that first began the work of running trade excursions,
an idea that has grown with each year. The trip of this spring, to Le
Mars, via the Illinois Central and return via Sheldon, Mason City, and
Calmar on the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul, occupying four days with
ninety in the party, was by all odds the best and most profitable of
all the series.

Within the past year a new and valuable department has been created in
the freight traffic bureau. The work of this department is to bring
about an equitable condition in freight rates for Cedar Rapids, as
compared with other cities of like location and surroundings and
eliminate discriminatory freight rates as compared with other jobbing
centers. In the prosecution of the work of this bureau, the Commercial
Club has been most successful, for up to the present time adjustments
brought about by the bureau represent a saving of about $24,000 per
year to the manufacturers, jobbers and business men of the city. In
addition to the work of bringing about an equalization of freight
rates, an individual service is maintained for the purpose of examining
freight claims against the railway companies. In this particular many
claims of long standing have been satisfactorily adjusted.

The Commercial Club has a present membership of 280, made up of the
leading business and professional men of the city. It is a live, active
organization, reflecting the best and most progressive citizenship of
the community. The club apartments occupy a large portion of the fourth
floor of the Masonic Temple, are commodious and comfortable, and form a
gathering place for the discussion of matters which affect the business
prosperity of the city. Regular meetings of the board of directors are
held every Monday noon, following a lunch served in the directors'
room, and at these meetings the docket for the week is cleared up. It
is a significant fact that these meetings are attended by practically
the entire membership of the directory and that no matter is allowed to
drag for want of immediate attention.

The officers and directors of the Commercial Club at the present time
are: President, J. F. Rall; first vice-president, F. Junkermann; second
vice-president, S. G. Armstrong; secretary, John Wunderlich; treasurer,
L. W. Anderson; directors, J. W. Barry, J. S. Broeksmit, W. L. Cherry,
J. M. Denning, Kent C. Ferman, J. M. Grimm, W. G. Haskell, Geo. T.
Hedges, E. E. Pinney, R. I. Safely, John H. Taft.


WHO PAID THE TAXES IN CEDAR RAPIDS FIFTY YEARS AGO

BY THOMAS DEVENDORF

Cedar Rapids has made many changes and improvements during the past
half century. But perhaps no change has been so great as the change in
the valuation of property. In 1858 there was a population of only about
thirty-five hundred within the city limits, and in the entire county
only eighteen thousand. Twenty per cent of the population then resided
in Cedar Rapids. Today we claim nearly thirty-five thousand and over
fifty per cent of the entire population of the county. At that time the
area of the city was very much less than at present. Franklin street,
now Eleventh street east, was as far as was platted. Beyond was heavily
wooded and used in summers for picnic parties; to the south Carpenter's
first addition had already been laid and but very few of the lots had
been improved, the lower end, where the packing plant of T. M. Sinclair
& Co. is located, was used as a race track, where the local horsemen
competed. Kingston, on the west side of the river, was an independent
municipality, having its own city government and city officers, and
remained so until the year 1870, when it was annexed and became a part
of the present Cedar Rapids.

The assessed valuation of the city for the year 1858 was for both real
estate and personal the sum of $535,912--what proportion that amount
will bear to the real cash value of the property the writer is unable
to state. But it is the rule generally adopted by assessors to make the
value much less than the price parties would buy and sell the same
property for, and on this assessment of $535,912 a levy was made of two
mills on the dollar, which, if the collector was diligent and had good
luck, would have produced the sum of $1,071.00, which the city officers
could use to carry on the affairs of the city--pay salaries, make
improvements, grade streets, build crossings, and to meet all other
expenses of the city. That this sum was inadequate for the purpose is
shown by the fact that the larger share of the taxes of this year were
paid in what they denominated "city script," which we call city
warrants, so that the city fathers had very little real cash in the
city treasury. This city script was issued for work and salaries and
such other expenses as were necessary and was not interest bearing, so
that a party that had such script was ready to dispose of the same to
the best advantage he could, and parties that had taxes to pay would
gather up such script at what discount they could get and use it for
the purpose of paying their taxes. The larger tax payers all paid in
"city script."

The city officials of that time are all dead. R. C. Rock was mayor;
George Seymour, recorder; A. S. Koontz, treasurer; A. S. Belt, city
attorney.

J. J. Snouffer and John G. Graves were the aldermen from the first
ward; D. W. Sprague and R. R. Taylor, aldermen from the second ward;
Wm. Richmond and S. A. Shattuck, aldermen from the third ward.

There are only eight residents of this city at the present time whose
names appear on the tax list of fifty years ago; the only ones we can
remember are the following: James Bird, Isaac Carroll, E. Coulter, C.
Fordyce, Jos. Perigo, David Lighty, P. F. Randall, and Wesley Stephens.
Some of the above paid a poll tax only. David Lighty paid tax on lot 3,
block 28, original town, and has paid taxes on this same lot all the
years since and owns the property today. Isaac Whittam paid the taxes
on lot 5, block 13, original town. This is the corner lot on which the
Montrose Hotel is located. The lot was then valued at $550, and the tax
was $1.10. Isaac Carroll paid the taxes on three city lots, the total
value of which was $585; also on two horses, value $150; one carriage,
value $75; his tax was $1.92, paid in script. E. Coulter paid on a
stock of merchandise (drugs) valued at $800.

A few others who are listed on the tax books of half a century ago are
known to be living, but have removed to other places.

W. W. Smith, of Minneapolis, who was an active business man at that
time, owned five lots on Second street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues
east, on which he built a large brick building, intending to use it as
a hotel. It was, however, used as a residence property, and was known
as the Wadsworth Block. This property was located where the Illinois
Central railroad lately erected their fine new freight depot, corner of
Fifth avenue and Second street.

S. D. Carpenter, now a resident of Chicago, paid the taxes on the south
280 feet of out lot 4, valued at $850, tax $1.90. This property is
located on Third avenue, between Eighth and Tenth streets, and includes
the homes of A. Sinclair, Rev. Burkhalter, Ed. Clark, and the late home
of Robert Williams.

Geo. Greene was the largest individual taxpayer of that day. He was
assessed with some 70 city lots. Many of them were in the business part
of town, the total assessed value of these was $28,575, and the tax was
$56.40.

In his list were lots 3, 4, 5, 6, block 24 original plat, property on
which is now located the Allison hotel, the College Inn and the three
business rooms to the west, all on First avenue. Also a lot at corner
of Second avenue and Fourth street, now owned by Mr. C. Magnus; these
four lots were valued at $2,200 and the tax was $4.40. He owned lots 4
and 5 block 42 assessed at $300 each. These are now the homes of Dr.
Geo. Carpenter and Mike Ford. He also paid the taxes on 125 feet on
First street lots now occupied by the Rudolph block, the Gazette
office, Geo. C. Haman drug store and Geo. Yuill farm implements. The
total value of this 125 feet was $3,600, the taxes $7.20. At that time
this property was occupied by a large three story hotel called Greene's
hotel, and it is said by those who were guests of the house that it was
one of the best west of Chicago. The next largest taxpayer was John F.
Ely, who was assessed on 38 building lots at an assessed value of
$24,800 and on which he paid a tax of $51.16. Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, block
14, original plat, was valued at $3,500.00, tax on same $7.00. This was
his home. A comfortable, unpretentious cottage occupied the center of
block, surrounded by shrubbery, flowers and many apple trees. These
lots are now occupied by the large business houses of Jones & Luberger,
Martin Dry Goods Co., the Dows block on the corner of Second street
and Second avenue, and also Snowden's, corner of Third street and
Second avenue. He also was assessed with the property now belonging to
the Churchill estate, corner of First street and Second avenue, value
$1,150.00, tax on same $2.30. Lot 10, block 24, original plat, now
occupied by the Cedar Rapids National Bank and for many years known as
the old Baptist church corner, was assessed at $700.00 and the tax was
$1.40.

Mr. Ely was also the owner of lots 4, 5, 8, 9, block 15, which is now
the John H. Taft corner, and the store of Ludy & Taylor, all on First
avenue, together with the property on which is located the "Oriel"
block and part of the next lot to the west, both on Second avenue.
These four lots now just in the most valuable part of the business
district, were valued at $2,850.00, on which he paid the city tax of
$5.70. The lot on the corner of Second avenue and Fifth street on which
the Public Library is located, was one of his lots and is one that he
continued to own up to the time it was condemned by the library board
for the purpose of erecting the library building. This lot was assessed
at $425.00, tax paid 85 cents. He was also the owner of lots 8, 9, 10,
block 23, original plat. These are on First avenue between Fourth and
Fifth streets. These three lots were assessed at $1,350.00, tax paid on
same, $2.70.

The lots 1 and 2, block 4, was also included in his district. These are
on the corner of First street and Second avenue. It was regarded as
valuable property by the assessor of fifty years ago, as he has these
two lots assessed at $3,700.00. No other two lots in the city were
rated at so high a value as these. This must have been regarded as the
best business location of that day.

The next Cedar Rapids tax payer who had to gather up the next largest
amount of city scrip with which to pay his city tax was Mr. N. B.
Brown, who was assessed with 47 city lots the total value of which was
$20,750. This with some personal property, as merchandise, horses, cows
and bridge stock made his total property valuation $23,290.00 and on
this amount he paid a city tax of $46.58. Mr. Brown was one of the
owners of the original plat of the city and many pieces of property
which are now very valuable was at that time set off to him as his
share of the original town plat.

Lots 3 and 4, block 25, are two valuable pieces of property. These are
on Second avenue between Third and Fourth streets and on which is
located the Damour Grocery House, and some of the property on which the
new government postoffice is erected. These two lots were assessed at
$900.00 on which he paid a tax of $1.80. Mr. Brown also was the owner
of lots 6, 7, 8, block 23. These were on the north side of First avenue
and extended from Fourth street west to where the Grand hotel now is
and included the Chicago & Northwestern freight depot, the Pullman
House, the Delavan hotel and the property now owned by Mr. Lansing and
used as a saloon. These three valuable lots were then assessed at
$1,700.00 on which he paid the tax of $3.40.

Another fine piece of property was his home, which was the entire block
38. His fine brick residence was located in the center of the block and
was at that day one of the finest dwellings in this part of the state.
These ten lots which were all included was valued at $3,250.00. This
property has been sold and sub-divided until the only part left is the
southeast corner of the block which N. E. Brown his son, now occupies
with a fine modern brick dwelling, directly opposite Grace Episcopal
church.

He was also the owner of the property on which Gorman's hotel is
located. This hotel was built by Mr. Brown and a few years after it was
considered the best hotel to be found in this part of the state. The
upper story was finished for an amusement place and before the building
of Greene's opera house this was the only place that could be used for
that purpose.

Mr. Brown was largely engaged in milling at that time and owned and
operated a woolen mill and also a flouring mill, the buildings of both
are still standing but have not been in operation for some time.

Greene, Merritt & Co. were the bankers of that period and were assessed
with one city lot, corner of First street and B avenue, value $700.00,
together with their bank capital $20,000. Their city tax was $41.50.
The senior member of this firm was Geo. Greene, who was the largest
real estate owner of that date and who has been mentioned before in
this article. Mr. Merritt, the other member of the banking firm, was a
brother-in-law of Mr. Greene. Messrs. Geo. Greene, Wm. Greene and
Joseph Greene were brothers and together were largely instrumental in
shaping the development and growth of Cedar Rapids. They had faith in
its future and did not hesitate to give their money and their time to
every effort made to advance, build up and beautify their home city.

Wm. Greene was assessed with some twenty city lots, the value of which
was $5,625.00, which with some personal property assessed to him made
his total valuation $6,360 and his tax paid in city scrip $12.72. He
was the owner of the east 1/2 of out lot 6 and Mr. Merritt was the
owner of the west 1/2 of the same out lot. This property was assessed
at $19.00, for both Mr. Greene's and Mr. Merritt's part. This out lot
is situated between Fourth and Fifth avenues and Eighth and Tenth
streets and is now built up with some of the finest homes in the city.
A. C. Taylor, Luther A. Brewer, Mrs. N. Bourne, Henry S. Josselyn, Dr.
Ruml, Wm. H. Dutton, Geo. A. Mullin, John H. Taft, and many others have
homes in this out lot.

Greene Brothers were assessed with eight lots, all well inside the
business district, which were valued at $5,085.00; tax on same $10.17;
lots 6 and 7, block 16, value $1,300.00; tax $2.60. These lots are on
the corner of First avenue and Third street and are now occupied by
Tony Naso on the corner for a fruit store and the balance of the lots
by the "Fair Company."

Mr. Daniels was another large owner of Cedar Rapids real estate, fifty
years ago. The assessor for that year had him listed with 38 city lots
besides four entire out lots, together they were assessed at
$17,025.00, and the tax on the entire property was $34.05, all paid in
the usual city script. Some of this property lying in and near the
business part has become quite valuable. Lot 2, block 5, being a lot on
Second street between Third and Fourth avenue, was listed by the
assessor at $500.00. This piece of property was sold to John Murray
some two years ago for some $12,000.00, or thereabouts. This is now
occupied by the interurban railway as their depot. Another piece
assessed to the same party, lot 6, block 12, corner of Third street and
Fourth avenue, the rear part of this lot is being improved this present
season by the Bohemian Turners. This lot was assessed at $425. Tax on
same, 85 cents. Mr. Daniels was also owner of lots 8 and 9, block 14.
These lots are on Third avenue between Second and Third street and are
owned by Sam Armstrong and John S. Ely, the assessed value of the two
lots was $1,250.00 and tax on lots $2.50.

Lot 10, block 42, value $375.00. This is the corner lot on which the
Methodist church is located. Lot 1, block 43, value $350.00. This is

     I hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and correct
     copy of the original act now on file in the said office.

FIRST CITY OFFICIALS OF CEDAR RAPIDS

At 1 o'clock of April 4, 1849, the citizens of Cedar Rapids met at the
school house, in accordance with the requirements of the law, and
proceeded to elect town officers under a charter issued by the
legislature and approved January 15, 1849 (for text of this document
see Laws of Iowa, 1849, p. 116). The first election was in the nature
of a mass meeting. William P. Harman was made chairman and Arven
Kennedy, John H. Brooks, and John G. Cole selected as judges of
election. Eber L. Mansfield was clerk of election. These judges
certified to choice of votes as follows:

     Mayor, Martin L. Barber.
     Councilmen, Joseph Greene, Stephen L. Pollock, and James Leverich.
     Recorder, Homer Kennedy.

The mayor immediately took the oath of office before John L. Shearer,
justice of the peace.

The first meeting of the council was held May 11, 1849. Action was
taken appointing Lowell Daniels treasurer of the town, to give bonds of
$20. It was resolved that the municipal seal "shall consist of a raised
circle nine-tenths of an inch in diameter, enclosing an equilateral
triangle." The first ordinance in preamble declared, that "there exists
in the town divers unwholesome cellars, dung heaps, horse stables, cow
stables, barns, yards, hogpens, and other nuisances." The object of the
enactment was to abate these conditions. In July, 1849, Homer Kennedy
resigned as recorder and Porter W. Earle was chosen in his place. A
sort of omnibus ordinance was passed October 23, 1849. This prohibited
the sale of spirituous liquors, required that shows or other
exhibitions should pay license of not less than one dollar nor more
than ten dollars. A further section fixed penalties for disturbance of
any public meeting. This ordinance was given effective publication by
being "posted at G. Greene & Bro.'s store." Other ordinances, we find,
were "posted on John Coffman's door." John H. Brooks, marshal of the
town, was on November 8, 1849, allowed the sum of $16.73. Getting
possession of so much money he immediately resigned, presumably to
enjoy it without official cares.


THE SECOND ELECTION

The second election was held at the school house April 3, 1850. For
mayor Martin L. Barber received 39 votes and Johnson Hill 27. For
recorder John Palmer received 63 and Lawson Daniels 1. Stephen L.
Pollock, Thomas Downing and Charles C. Cook were the successful
councilmen, the defeated candidates being George H. Ely, Joseph Greene,
Isaac Cook, and W. P. Harman.

This new council on April 11, 1850, resolved to form a board of health,
but at the next meeting this action was rescinded. In its stead an
ordinance was passed for preservation of public health. Enforcement of
these provisions rested with the marshal. In May an ordinance was
passed permitting Harvey C. Higley to retail ardent spirits, upon
giving a good and sufficient bond "to keep a good and orderly house,
not permitting any gambling, drunkenness or rioting about his house or
premises." Such bond Mr. Higley refused to execute, and the employment
of counsel was authorized to commence suit against him for violation of
ordinance. July 24 a health board was appointed consisting of Drs. J.
F. Ely, S. D. Carpenter, and J. C. Traer. The marshal, under direction
of the board, was to abate all nuisances. The first recorders of the
city were evidently not of fixed mind or habitation. John Palmer
resigned as such December 8, and S. C. Koontz was chosen to fill the
vacancy. Isaac Cook was made attorney for the city in pending
litigation.


THE FIRST TAX LEVY

The first tax levy mentioned was ordered by action of council December
16, 1850. This amounted to "one and one-half mills on the dollar of all
taxable property within the corporation," and Johnson Hill was
appointed assessor. Another ordinance to prevent the sale of spiritous
and intoxicating liquors was passed December 16, 1850. Any quantity
less than a gallon sold "without advice of a physician," rendered the
seller liable to a fine of not less than five dollars nor more than
twenty-five. A license fee of from one to five dollars was exacted from
all peddlers, whether they were footmen with packs or sold goods from
wagons.


THE ELECTION OF 1851

Annual town election was again held in April, 1851. At this time
Nicholas B. Brown was chosen as mayor. Benjamin Weizer, Michael Bryan,
and Joseph A. Love, councilmen, and S. C. Koontz, recorder. William G.
Furman was appointed marshal. The personnel of the board of health was
also changed. Dr. L. Larrabee, Dr. Thomas, and Dr. John F. Ely
constituting the same.

No recorded meeting of council was held from June 20, 1851, to February
24 of the next year. At this latter date N. B. Brown, mayor, by advice
and consent of the councilmen, "did grant license to David W. King for
free navigation of the Cedar River, opposite this place, for the term
of one year from the 1st day of March, 1857, by the said D. W. King
paying to the recorder the sum of ten dollars." The council fixed rates
of toll as follows: Horse and rider 10 cents; footmen, 5 cents; one
horse and wagon, 15 cents; a wagon and two horses, 20 cents; and every
additional span of horses or yoke of cattle, 20 cents. Loose cattle not
exceeding five in number, he shall be allowed 5 cents per head; if more
than that number, 3 cents per head. Hogs, if not exceeding twenty-five
in number, shall be 2 cents per head; if more than that number the toll
shall be 1 cent per head. Sheep at the rate of 1 cent per head.


THE FIRST SIDEWALK ORDINANCE

The first sidewalk ordinance stipulated: "The sidewalks of Commercial
street shall be planked or paved, commencing at the corner of Benton
and Commercial streets, northeast side, and ending at the corner of
Sugar and Commercial streets. Also on the southwest side of said
street, commencing at the southeast side of Rock and Brather's shop and
coming up as far us Linn street. In case where planked the plank to be
oak and not less than one and one-half inches in thickness, also to be
placed upon a good and permanent foundation. In the front of buildings
the walk to be made ten feet in width, not less than five stringers to
be used. In front of lots or parts of lots not occupied by buildings it
is only required that walks be made five feet in width, in which case
three stringers are sufficient, but not less than three. All of which
must be completed by the 1st of September, 1852."

Samuel Brazelton was appointed marshal, Dr. Koontz treasurer, and Dr.
S. D. Carpenter, Wm. D. Wood, and Porter W. Earle, health board.


THE ELECTION OF 1853

In 1853 election was held on Wednesday, April 6. W. W. Smith was chosen
mayor; S. C. Bever, Johnson Hill, and J. F. Ely, councilmen; and S. C.
Koontz, recorder. Hiram Deem was appointed assessor, Isaac N. Whittam,
town marshal. At this same date, May 6, 1853, John F. Ely was made
committee to secure a surveyor, "Major McKean, or some other suitable
person to take and establish the grades of the city of Cedar Rapids."
Pratt R. Skinner was the person selected and his report and profile
were presented and adopted July 6, 1853. Hiram Deem was made marshal
July 23, Mr. Whittam evidently not having qualified. At this meeting a
municipal tax levy of four mills was ordered. Hiram Deem, having
accomplished his work as assessor, and now being marshal, was
instructed to collect the taxes. He was further directed to order out
men to work the roads and streets immediately.


THE CEMETERIES

The beginning of Oak Hill cemetery dates from an ordinance of August
23, 1853. Gabriel Carpenter had purchased 300 acres of land adjoining
the city and including the site of the cemetery. The place of burial at
that time was upon the ground after owned by Coe College. The ordinance
enacted that "the proposition made by G. Carpenter in respect to ten
acres of land for purpose of graveyard be filed and accepted. Provided,
however, that if the collegiate institute will pay the aforesaid G.
Carpenter for the aforementioned ten acres of land, and, further
provided, that if the mayor and council hold and possess the power and
right to sell and convey the lot of land now occupied by a graveyard
(within the corporate limits) and can sell and convey the same to the
Collegiate Institute for the sum of three hundred dollars, then the
afore-mentioned proposition is accepted."

The legal and other difficulties in the way were surmounted and on
February 22, 1854, it was resolved to quit claim the interest of the
town in the present burial ground to Smith and Carpenter, at such time
as they shall lay off and deed to the corporation a block of ground in
the Washington cemetery for a "potter's field," which shall contain at
least three acres. It was conditioned also that Smith and Carpenter
should give bond for the careful removal of all occupants of the
present burial ground before making any use of the land.


ELECTION OF 1854

On April 3, 1854, William W. Smith was elected mayor, William Greene,
Abraham Sines, and Daniel Lothian, councilmen, and William M. Wood,
recorder. The digging of sand from Iowa avenue was dignified by name of
bringing to grade. This was divided into six parts, and two were let to
W. W. Smith and E. Robins. These paid five dollars apiece for the
privilege. The other sections remained as before and the avenue was
rendered impassable. J. J. Snouffer was appointed marshal for ensuing
year and R. C. Rock treasurer. The famous "hog ordinance," which was
intended to keep swine from the street but failed absolutely in its
purpose, was introduced June 28, 1854.


ELECTION OF 1855

George Greene was elected mayor April 4, 1855. Members of the council
were first styled aldermen on the tickets for this year and R. C. Rock,
Joseph A. Love, and J. F. Charles were chosen. W. D. Watrous was the
choice of the voters for recorder. J. H. Atwell was appointed marshal
and S. D. Carpenter, treasurer. The council was organized into proper
committees, indicating that more business came before the body. The
bond of the treasurer had by this time increased to one thousand
dollars. A city attorney was elected June 5, 1855, James J. Child being
the choice of the council. The report of the finance committee showed a
deficit--the city's revenues lacking $75.00 of meeting expenses.


ELECTION OF 1856

Isaac Whittam was elected mayor at the April election in 1856, with
Walker, Smith, and Hager, councilmen. The recorder having resigned, D.
M. McIntosh was elected by the council to that office. The ferry
privileges had passed at death of D. W. King in 1854 to Stephen L.
Pollock and afterwards to Bowling & Gilbreath. Both of these failed to
pay for license, and the recorder was instructed to collect; Joseph
Hollan was appointed road supervisor.

On June 14, 1856, City Attorney James J. Child was instructed to
prepare an amended charter to be submitted to the next legislature.
This was accepted by council, June 28, 1856. The proposition was then
submitted to the voters and adopted 45 to 2. An election for city
officers under this new charter was ordered to be held at the office of
J. J. Child August 7, 1856. The votes cast were canvassed by the
council. It was found that 204 votes were cast for mayor, of which
Isaac N. Whittam received 120 and W. W. Smith 84. For recorder and
assessor D. M. McIntosh led with 123; F. P. Huntington 73; E. N. Bates
and S. C. Koontz one each. For treasurer and collector S. C. Koontz
received 121 votes and John P. Conkey 79. Charles Weare was elected
marshal by a vote of 131. In vote for aldermen in the first ward J. T.
Walker was elected and J. J. Snouffer and H. G. Angle were tied.
Alexander Hager and J. F. Charles were chosen to represent the second
ward, and Henry S. Ward and W. D. Watrous were duly elected from the
third ward.

This closes the official doings under the old town. The records
consulted will satisfy and settle all disputed questions as to
office-holding and the statements here made are correct beyond all
question.

CITY OF CEDAR RAPIDS AS IT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO

The following interesting account of early Cedar Rapids is taken from
_Voice of Iowa_ for April, 1857, edited by James L. Enos. The article
was written by Mr. Enos himself:

     "What constitutes the present city of Cedar Rapids, is
     embraced mainly by sections 21, 22, 27 and 28, in T. 83 N.,
     R. 7 W., in the township of Rapids in Linn county. The
     location is one of the most delightful to be found in any of
     the rich valleys of the west, being on the northeast side of
     the Cedar river, on a plain rising above the river's bed,
     and reaching back nearly half a mile, with but very slight
     depressions or uprisings, serving to render the plat one of
     great convenience for building, and giving a peculiar grace
     to its appearance.

     "In the rear of this table-land a somewhat abrupt elevation,
     varying from 20 to 40 feet, occurs, which is covered with a
     luxuriant growth of native oak. Upon this are the most
     beautiful and romantic sites for residences, being
     sufficiently elevated to overlook the entire valley for
     miles in either direction. Back of this the depressions and
     elevations alternate, making this portion of the city a
     series of circular, undulating swells.

     "The city proper also extends on the west side of the river
     and embraces numerous other positions which are being
     occupied with rapidity and improved with taste, and though
     not embraced within the present city limits, forms of
     necessity a part of the Valley City.

     "Cedar Rapids is situated due west of Chicago, the present
     emporium of the west, and is the present terminus of the
     principal trunk railroad from that city penetrating the
     heart of the northwest. It is 75 miles southwest from
     Dubuque, 80 miles nearly west from Clinton, about the same
     distance from Davenport, 55 miles from Muscatine, and about
     110 from Des Moines--the capital of Iowa.


NATURAL ADVANTAGES

     "Few interior cities are blessed with more natural
     advantages than Cedar Rapids. The rapids in the Cedar river
     are the first met with after leaving the Mississippi, and no
     more occur of any considerable amount for many miles above.
     These afford one of the best water powers in the west, and
     with proper dams would afford power sufficient to run all
     machinery that will ever be required on either side of the
     river, even though our population should reach fifty
     thousand. Surrounding the town for miles is one of the
     richest agricultural districts in the Union, forming a part
     of the Cedar valley country which Professor Owen has taken
     as his type of perfection in fertility. There is a plentiful
     supply of timber for all ordinary uses--numerous groves are
     scattered upon the surrounding hills--giving the appearance
     of an enchanted garden--probably unsurpassed in richness by
     any region of equal extent on the American continent.

     "Its position in reference to other towns and cities is such
     as must of necessity make it a great railroad center, and
     several are already projected, and one under contract to
     this city. We shall speak more fully of this class of
     advantages in another portion of this article.

     "In point of healthfulness, it will compare favorably with
     any of the river towns, the diseases being chiefly of a
     bilious nature, and yielding readily to very simple
     treatment. This fact applies with very general truth to all
     the valleys of Iowa--while the more elevated districts are
     more free from malaria, they are subject to a disease of a
     more complex and serious character. This may seem fabulous
     to the casual observer, but we feel assured that the
     combined experience of western practitioners will bear
     testimony to the correctness of our statements.

SETTLEMENT

     "There is always more or less of interest connected with the
     early days of any city, and it is not until years after that
     the record becomes of value. The pioneer suffers privations
     and trials of which future occupants can realize but little.
     In fact, the honor paid them is seldom equal to their merits
     and oftentimes they are as illy prepared to receive as
     others are to bestow sympathy and praise. Among the first
     settlers of this city were some men of the first character,
     and are yet with us, while others have moved farther on, to
     enjoy what habit has taught them to love, a frontier life,
     and a few have gone down to the gate of common entry, their
     years being full and their memories yet linger, and make us
     glad that we lived with, knew and loved them. Of this number
     we name that generous and true man, D. W. King. Esq., who
     departed from our midst in the autumn of 1854.

     "The first man, however, who pitched his tent on the ground
     now occupied by the Valley City, was a counterfeiter and
     horse thief, of no little notoriety, by the name of Shepard,
     who took up his abode and erected a log house on what is now
     Linn street, near the mills, some time in the year 1838.

     "D. W. King and Thomas Gainer, the first settlers of any
     advantage to the country, reached here in 1839 and soon
     after made a permanent settlement on the west side of the
     river.

     "The house of Shepard was soon found to be the home of a
     lawless band of outlaws, who secreted much of their plunder
     on the islands in the river above the city. John Young and a
     man named Granger were connected with Shepard in their work.
     They stole at one time six horses and made good their escape
     with four of them. Granger was afterwards convicted of
     passing counterfeit money in Chicago and sentenced to the
     Alton prison for four years. The fate of Young is not known
     with certainty, yet there is evidence to induce the belief
     that he was executed for murder, in a neighboring state,
     though he assumed a different name.

     "The privations of the first settlers were at times very
     great, and though such as are not uncommon in the history of
     pioneer life, would cause many of our amateurs at the
     present time to sigh for the home of their childhood and a
     place at the luxurious tables of their fathers.


PROGRESS

     "In 1849 D. W. King established ferries for crossing the
     Cedar, and continued to run them up to the time of his
     death. The one doing most of the business was at the Iowa
     avenue crossing. As it is probable that these boats will
     soon, if indeed they have not already made their last
     voyage, a brief note of them may not be out of place in this
     connection. They were self-propellers, being forced across
     the river by the power of the current. A wire rope extended
     across the stream upon which a pulley was placed, and
     connected by means of two ropes to the boat.

     "The first dam across the Cedar was commenced in 1842, and
     the first saw mill erected in 1843, and is still running.

     "In March, 1843, the lands came into the market. The first
     flouring mill was erected in 1844-5 at a cost of $3,000, by
     the present owner. In 1845 A. Ely erected the second saw
     mill, and the second flouring mill the following year, the
     latter costing about $9,000. In 1848-9 the woolen factory
     was erected at a cost of about $8,000. The first saw mill
     was erected in 1850 by Greene, Legare & Co. This has a chair
     and bedstead factory connected and cost about $4,000. These
     are all propelled by water power. In 1855-6, Greene & Graves
     erected a steam saw mill, and containing also a variety of
     other machinery. The first and only mill erected on the
     west side of the river went into operation in the summer of
     1856. The first steam engine was stationed in this city by
     A. Hager, in his machine shop, sash, blind, and door factory
     in 1855. The second by Greene & Graves, and the third by S.
     L. Pollock.

     "The first store was opened by J. Greene, in the building
     now occupied by the postoffice, on the northwest corner of
     Iowa avenue and Washington street.

     "The second store was opened by Mr. Cleveland, and C. R.
     Mulford the third. This was located on Commercial street,
     and was destroyed by fire in 1850, being the first building
     thus destroyed in Cedar Rapids. No fire occurred thereafter
     until late in the autumn of 1855, when most of the block
     embraced on the west side of Commercial street, between Iowa
     avenue and Linn street, was consumed. No fire has occurred
     since.

     "The postoffice was established in 1847, and J. Greene
     appointed postmaster.

     "The first brick buildings were erected in 1844, the
     building on the southwest corner of Iowa avenue and
     Commercial street, and the dwelling house on the northwest
     corner of Iowa avenue and Washington street. The present
     Union House was the first hotel.

     "The village of Cedar Rapids was laid out and the plat
     recorded in 1842. At this time, two log buildings
     constituted the village, and the total population was six
     persons.

     "A public school house was erected in 1846 or '47, and the
     first school taught by Nelson Felch. This structure is now
     occupied as a dwelling, on the northwest corner of Eagle and
     Madison streets. The first church, Presbyterian, was erected
     in 1850.

     "The first newspaper was published in 1851 by D. O. Finch,
     entitled the _Progressive Era_. It was continued under this
     name by various owners and editors until September, 1854,
     when it was purchased by J. L. Enos and F. A. Wilmans, and
     its name changed to the _Cedar Valley Times_ by which name
     it yet flourishes. In politics republican, it is at present
     published by J. G. Davenport. The second paper was
     established in January, 1856, under the editorial management
     of J. L. Enos, entitled the _Cedar Valley Farmer_, but was
     discontinued at the close of the first volume. The _Cedar
     Rapids Democrat_ was the third paper--commenced in June,
     1856, by W. W. Perkins & Co. This is still published.
     Democratic in politics, the _Times_ and the _Democrat_ are
     both good papers, and appear to be well sustained.

     "_The Voice of Iowa_ was commenced in January, 1857, under
     the auspices of the Iowa Teachers' Association, Phonetic
     Association, etc., J. L. Enos, editor and publishing agent,
     assisted by a number of corresponding editors. This journal
     has met with more than ordinary success, the circulation
     passing 1,000 during the first three months and commanding
     nearly $1,000 in advertising patronage, thus showing that
     the people of Iowa are aroused to the importance of paying
     due attention to the education of their youth.

     "The foundation for a very large graded school was laid in
     the summer of 1856, but owing to the large amount of work
     contracted and the scarcity of workmen, the completion was
     of necessity deferred. It is designed to complete it early
     the coming summer, and when finished will form one of the
     finest educational structures in the state.

     "During the past two years the growth of Valley City has
     been equaled by few towns even in the west. It now contains
     many blocks that would do credit to any eastern city.

     "The present city charter was adopted in the summer of 1856,
     and Isaac Whittam, Esq., was elected mayor. A free bridge
     across the Cedar was commenced in 1855, and is now ready for
     crossing by teams. The chief credit of this structure is due
     to a few, though many stood manfully by the free bridge and
     aided liberally in its erection. A charter for a toll bridge
     was obtained about the time that the free bridge charter
     was procured, which gave rise to a warm controversy in which
     much interest was manifest. The free bridge finally
     triumphed, and its noble arches now span the Cedar with
     every appearance of remaining for many years a proud
     monument to the energy and liberality of those who aided in
     placing it there. We have already intimated that Cedar
     Rapids is the center of a very large and increasing trade,
     and though not destined to become a city of the first
     magnitude, is destined to rank as one of the principal
     interior cities of Iowa. Its railroad connections--immense
     water power--the fertility of the surrounding country and
     the energy of its people will give it rank and importance as
     a manufacturing city, worthy of note.

     "Nor is this imaginary, as the following statistics will
     show. Cedar Rapids now contains: 4 flouring mills, 2 door,
     sash and blind, and planing mills, 1 cooper and barrel
     factory, 5 wagon and carriage factories, 1 iron factory, 2
     cabinet furniture and chair factories, 3 plow factories, 3
     boot and shoe factories, 2 saddle and harness manufactories,
     4 tin, copper and sheet iron establishments, 1 woolen
     factory, 5 brick yards, 2 agricultural implement
     manufactories, 3 merchant tailor establishments, 2 wood
     turning establishments, 3 newspapers and magazines, 1 brick
     machine factory, 8 grocery and provision stores, 5 clothing
     stores, 5 dry-goods stores, 1 millinery and fancy goods
     store, 6 liquor and cigar shops, 4 drug stores, 2
     silversmith, clock and jewelry stores, 4 hardware stores, 3
     book stores, 1 book bindery, 5 public and private halls, 5
     hotels, 4 churches, 4 lumber yards, 3 banking houses, 1
     public reading room, 1 shaving and hair dressing
     establishment.

[Illustration: CEDAR RAPIDS IN 1856]

     "A paper mill is in contemplation, and there is room and
     excellent openings for other branches of business.

     "A hat and cap manufactory--pork packing establishment--in
     fact nearly every branch of manufactory not included in the
     above would do well. There are two nurseries contiguous to
     town, where nearly every kind of fruit and a large variety
     of ornamental trees can be procured. The Mound nursery is
     one of the oldest and most extensive in the country, and the
     proprietor furnishes orders on very liberal terms."

The following letter to A. T. Hall, as to a gavel, at the meeting of
carpenters of America at Des Moines, 1910, gives some interesting facts
as to early days in Cedar Rapids:

     "Dear Sir: In reply to your request for such information as
     I have concerning the small mallet or gavel which you had
     made from a piece of the red cedar shaft, I can only say
     that there is but little to its history. My father, the late
     Nicholas Brodhead Brown, came to what is now the city of
     Cedar Rapids in 1839, but did not remain here at that time.
     He went as far north as Cedar Falls looking for a mill site,
     and returned to this location in 1840. After building the
     first manufacturing plant in Linn county for the Doty
     brothers, a saw mill in Bertram township, located near the
     mouth of Indian creek, he began in 1841 to improve the
     waterfall in the Cedar river at this place. He first built a
     temporary dam then built a saw mill, the second to be built
     in the county, for himself. He then began the building of
     the first flour mill in the county. This mill was completed
     and in operation either in 1843 or 1844, and from this mill
     came the cedar shaft from which the little mallet or gavel
     was made. There is no doubt in my mind about the cedar tree
     from which the mallet was made was cut very close to, and
     perhaps within the present limits of Cedar Rapids. Nicholas
     Brodhead Brown was in all probability the first mechanic who
     used edged tools, to locate in Cedar Rapids. Nor is there
     any doubt in my mind about his making the shaft above spoken
     of. It was the real shaft in the old bolting chest in the
     mill known as Brown's Mill. Mr. Brown by occupation was a
     millwright and through force of circumstances worked at that
     trade for some twelve or fifteen years after his arrival
     here. He especially did all of the millwrighting that he
     could do himself on this mill, working twelve and fourteen
     hours a day for the purpose of getting it into operation as
     soon as possible, as not only he himself needed its income
     but the country all about this locality needed a mill.

     "Another of the early mechanics to come to Cedar Rapids was
     Samuel Sherwood, also a millwright. He worked for a time on
     Brown's flour mill, and on the Alexander Ely flour mill, now
     known as the Anchor mill. This was the second mill to begin
     operation in Cedar Rapids. The Ely mill began operating the
     same year as the Brown's, but later on in the year. Another
     of the old-time mechanics, a user of edged tools, was Joseph
     Love. He was the first cabinet-maker to locate in Cedar
     Rapids. Another was John Vardy; he was the second
     cabinet-maker to locate in Cedar Rapids, and was the builder
     of the first house in Cedar Rapids to be constructed of
     sawed lumber. The house still stands--is in use and owned by
     the Stary family. John F. Boyce, the father of William and
     Frank Boyce of this city, was another early mechanic. He
     also was a cabinet-maker. John Patterson, an uncle of Chas.
     A. Calder of this city, was another. He also was a
     cabinet-maker. All of these men worked to a greater or less
     extent at the carpenter's trade. In those days there were no
     trade unions and consequently no limitations on the kind of
     work a mechanic should do. To my mind these men could be
     classed as carpenters as well as millwrights and
     cabinet-makers. I should have said that Samuel Sherwood went
     to Independence from this city and became the founder of the
     milling industry at that thriving little place. I have
     diverged largely from the gavel, but believe it will be
     interesting to yourself and your fraternity to know who the
     first users of edged tools were in this part of Iowa.

                                  Respectfully yours,

                                          "N. E. BROWN."


HOW THE FIRST RAILROAD CAME TO CEDAR RAPIDS

T. DEVENDORF IN THE SUNDAY REPUBLICAN OF JUNE 10, 1906

The population of the city in 1856 was not to exceed 1,200 to 1,500
people. There was little wealth in the community. No manufacturing
enterprises had as yet located here. The principal dependence of the
people was in the farming community and the bountiful harvests that
Iowa never fails to produce.

The one great desire and ambition of the people was for a railroad to
the east on which they could transport their surplus product to an
eastern market. Railroad building had not been very extensive in the
west, the Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska had its track built as far west as
the Mississippi river and was formulating plans to bridge the river and
extend the road across the fertile prairies of Iowa. Some of our
pioneer citizens with shrewd business instincts and confidence in the
rapid settlement and development of the state, on the completion of the
railroad, became interested in this new project and advocated the
granting of a loan to them provided the road should be built to or
through our growing city. The subject of giving aid to this new
proposed railroad was discussed largely among the people, and on the
1st day of September, 1856, the city council passed a resolution
instructing the mayor to call an election of the qualified voters of
Cedar Rapids to vote on the question, shall the city in its corporate
capacity subscribe sixty thousand dollars to the capital stock of the
Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska railroad and pay for same in bonds issued by
the city. Said bonds were to bear interest at the rate of ten per cent
per annum, and were to mature 20 years after date at the option of the
city. The election was called by Mayor Isaac Whittam and held September
22, 1856, and resulted in the very decisive vote of 111 for the
proposition and only 2 against it.

[Illustration: THE OLD BLAIR BUILDING, NOW THE SITE OF THE KIMBALL
BUILDING]

These bonds were to be issued in series as the work on the new road
progressed, fifteen thousand dollars worth when the contract was let
for building the road from De Witt to Cedar Rapids; the second series
of fifteen thousand dollars worth when the first five miles of grading
were completed in Linn county; and the balance of thirty thousand
dollars worth when the grading was finished into the city of Cedar
Rapids and the road in operation and cars running as far west as Mt.
Vernon.

On the 20th of February, 1857, Mayor Whittam in a report to the city
council made a statement that he, as representative of the city, had
attended the meeting of the stockholders of the Chicago, Iowa &
Nebraska, held on the 25th day of January, 1857, at Clinton and at that
time had passed over to the railroad company the fifteen bonds of one
thousand dollars each, to which they were entitled, they giving the
required stock certificates for same as per agreement. The railroad
company also entered into a contract with the city in which they agreed
to pay interest on said bonds and all others to be issued to the
railroad until such time as the road should be finished and the cars
running into the city of Cedar Rapids.

The mayor also complimented the men in charge of the affairs of the
road as men of means, honor, and energy, and finished his report by
predicting that when the road was completed it would be of great
benefit and advantage to our young but growing city. But
notwithstanding the financial aid and the general encouragement given
by the people the road advanced westward slowly and while the grading
had been nearly completed there were many other things necessary to
build a railroad and which could only be had by having the ready money
with which to buy such supplies. In June, 1857, another petition was
presented to the city council asking that the mayor call an election of
the legal voters of the city to vote on the question, shall the city
issue its bonds to the amount of forty thousand dollars to aid in
purchasing the iron rails to complete the road to Cedar Rapids, the
city to be a subscriber to the capital stock of the road to that
amount. On July 10, 1857, the mayor called the election to vote on the
proposition, shall the city in its corporate capacity issue its bonds
for forty thousand dollars, the money to be used to procure iron rails
and for no other purpose. The election was held on July 20, 1857, and
resulted as follows: For the proposition, 104 votes; against 25 votes.

These bonds were to be issued in series and were to be paid one-quarter
in 13 years, one-quarter in 14 years, one-quarter in 15 years, and the
balance in 16 years from date.

Some time after these bonds were issued and turned over to the railroad
company some legal point was raised touching their validity, and this
together with the fact that the financial standing of the railroad
company in the east among the iron manufacturers was not first class,
made it necessary that some other plan should be adopted to procure the
iron rails to build the road to Cedar Rapids. Heretofore they had found
it practicable to survey and locate and grade a road and pay for the
same in farm products, dry goods and groceries, etc. But when it came
to buying iron from the manufacturers it required the cash or a
suitable collateral. But our people were ready to meet this unforeseen
emergency. Six of our early and more wealthy citizens made notes of
$8,000.00 each, each note being signed by each of the other gentlemen,
making a joint note of each one and together amounting to the
$48,000.00. These notes were to be used as collateral and to strengthen
up their credit, so that the iron rails could be bought and the road
completed to this city. This was purely accommodation paper and the
road contracted that the interest and principal of these notes should
be paid by the railroad company from the first net earnings of the
company, but in the early years of the road there were no net earnings.
It was only by the most economical management that the operating
expenses could be met, and several years elapsed before these notes
given to aid the railroad were fully paid. The gentlemen aiding in the
early construction of the first railroad to Cedar Rapids were Gabriel
Carpenter, George Greene, Sampson C. Bever, J. J. Snouffer, and two
others whose names are not remembered.

After the railroad was completed and in operation to this place little
was said in regard to these city bonds. In the proceedings of the city
council June 13, 1860, a resolution was passed authorizing E. H.
Steadman, the mayor of the city, to represent the city at the annual
meeting of the stockholders of the C., I. & N. Ry., which was to be
held in Clinton at a later date.

On January 25, 1861, a committee was appointed consisting of the mayor,
I. N. Whittam, and Alderman G. Livensbarger who were to examine into
the legal condition of the city in relation to the $100,000.00 worth of
city bonds already issued for railroad purposes. What this
investigating committee did, and what their conclusions were, are not
matters of record. Nothing more is said in any of the proceedings of
the city council in regard to this matter until May 8, 1863, when it
appears from the preamble of a resolution introduced that the railroad
company was calling upon the city authorities to comply with the terms
of the contract entered into when the bonds were issued, which was that
the city should pay the interest on such bonds after the completion of
the road to this place.

The road had been finished and in operation some two years and still no
interest had been paid and the city made no efforts to collect any sum
for such purpose. At the meeting of the council May 8, 1863, a
resolution was introduced asking that a committee be appointed to
investigate and report on the recorded facts bearing upon this matter
of railroad bonds from its inception to this date. Aldermen McClelland,
Denlinger and Slonaker were desirous of having light on the subject and
voted for an investigation, but Aldermen Bever, Carroll and Stibbs
voted in the negative, and this being a tie vote it was decided by the
mayor, who also voted in the negative.

At the council meeting held June 11, 1864, another committee to
investigate was appointed who was authorized to procure legal advice in
regard to the liability of the city and also meet and confer with the
officers of the railroad company, and this committee consisting of
Aldermen McClelland and E. H. Steadman reported back to the council
that they had procured legal advice in the matter and from all data and
facts collected their attorney was of the opinion that the railroad
company had no legal claims against the city and that the bonds were
illegal and void.

In October of 1864 the same subject came up in the city council and a
committee of three consisting of S. C. Bever, H. C. Angle and John
Weare were appointed to confer with the railroad company and get the
best terms of settlement they could, either by taking reissued stock in
payment or a certain amount of money yearly in full settlement. This
committee were prompt in their investigations and reported back to the
council November 4, 1864. Their report was that they had a conference
with the railroad company and the best compromise they could obtain was
this:

First. That the city surrender to the company all its claims to stock
in said road.

Second. The railroad company would then return to the city $90,000.00
worth of the city bonds already issued together with all coupons on the
balance, leaving in the hands of the company $10,000.00 worth with all
coupons cut off to date. This surrendering of bonds to in no way affect
the legality of the bonds retained, the legal points to be settled
later.

At the meeting of the council Alderman Bever introduced a resolution
covering all the points made in the report of the committee that the
city surrender the stock and that the railroad company return the
$90,000.00 worth of bonds, leaving outstanding and in the hands of the
railroad company $10,000.00 worth of city bonds.

On the yeas and nays being called the following aldermen voted yea:
Bever, Denlinger, Holland and Slonaker, and in the negative, Alderman
McClelland, and the resolution was declared adopted.

Alderman McClelland then at once offered his resignation as alderman
from the Third ward and his resignation was as promptly accepted and
Wm. Richmond elected as his successor.

Nothing more appears in the records of the city council bearing on this
question of railroad bonds until June 29, 1866, when Alderman Adams of
the Third ward introduced a resolution that a committee of one
consisting of Alderman Snouffer be appointed to confer and negotiate
with Horace Williams, agent of the Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska railroad,
for the surrender of the outstanding bonds, and he was authorized to
release and exonerate the railroad company from performing certain acts
they had previously agreed to do. One was the grading of Jefferson
street and another was the grading of the North city park and the
building a fence of oak posts around said park, both of which they had
failed to do. These agreements of the railroad company the city would
relinquish, provided the railroad company would return the balance of
the city bonds in their hands, amounting to $10,000.00.

It is presumed that Alderman Snouffer failed to make these negotiations
with Horace Williams as instructed by the city council, at least there
is nothing in the records to show that this committee of one ever made
any report on this subject to the city council.

At the meeting of the city council held May 15, 1868, another committee
was appointed to investigate and try to induce the railroad company to
relinquish and return these outstanding city bonds and it is fair to
presume that the committee accomplished something in that direction as
at a subsequent meeting held June 26, 1868, Alderman Leach moved that
the city treasurer be authorized to receive the city bonds now in the
possession of the Chicago & Northwestern railroad and receipt for same.
This is the last record to be found in the proceedings of the city
council bearing on this subject of city bonds.

Going back to the time the railroad was built into Cedar Rapids it will
be remembered that little value was placed on the stock. People
subscribed for the stock and paid their subscriptions as called for
more to encourage the building of the road than for an investment.
Nearly every citizen had some few shares of the stock. They had all
done their share in getting the road here according to each one's means
and financial ability, and held their stock in the road. It was then
that men of means with confidence in the rapid growth and advancement
of this great state of Iowa began in a private way gathering up this
stock of the Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska R. R., buying up from the small
holders their stock at prices from 25 to 35 cents on the dollar of the
par value and in a few years the small holders had parted with their
holdings and in 1865 there was little or no stock of the Chicago, Iowa
& Nebraska R. R. to be had and in the latter part of that year the road
was merged into the Chicago & Northwestern system. At what price per
share the Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska went into the Northwestern is not
positively known, but it is generally supposed that one share of the
Chicago, Iowa & Nebraska R. R. was good for about three shares of the
new consolidated Chicago & Northwestern.


SOME OF THE EARLY BRICK HOUSES IN CEDAR RAPIDS

Charles Weare used to say that there was a brick building on the Y. M.
C. A. corner which was torn down many years ago, and which was supposed
to be one of the first brick buildings in Cedar Rapids; it was occupied
by Ingham Wood as a store building. Porter Earle erected one of the
first, if not the first, brick building at the corner of First avenue
and Second street where the Union Block is now standing, which was one
of the most commodious buildings of its kind in the city for many
years. The Michael Bryan family erected one of the first dwelling
houses of brick about where N. E. Brown's home now stands in 1849 or
1850, and for many years it was one of the best equipped houses in the
city and the west. This house had an open fire place in every room, and
consisted of eight rooms. The house was built according to the southern
style of architecture. Another member of the Bryan family erected a
stone and cement house about the same time at the corner of Third
avenue and Second street, which building was later occupied by the
family of William Greene.

D. M. McIntosh erected a one-story brick building near the present
library in 1850 or 1851, which building is still standing. About the
same time the father of James Snyder erected a brick dwelling which
stood on South Third street near where the Vardy cottage is located.
Greene's Hotel on First street was a brick structure erected between
1854 and 1855; it had an eighty feet front and ran back toward the
river about eighty feet. The picture of this building shows that it was
a four-story structure, although many claim that it was only a
three-story building. This buildup was erected by J. J. Snouffer; for
many years it was the largest and best equipped hotel in this part of
the west.

Part of the residence of Dr. Skinner was erected by George Berg and was
one of the most complete brick structures in this city. Elihu Baker
also erected a brick residence on the property now occupied by Dr. H.
W. Bender about the early '50s. Sampson C. Bever erected a brick
building on the premises where the Rock Island offices now stand, being
a two story structure similar to the Spangler residence which was
erected later across the street. In this structure Mr. Bever installed
the first hot air furnace used in Cedar Rapids, and a great many of the
early settlers came to inspect the house, and especially to examine the
hot air furnace which was a new thing in those days.

J. S. Cook in the early days erected a brick structure on the corner of
A avenue and Fifth street, which was one of the fine homes for many
years in this city. S. A. Shattuck built in the early '50s a brick
structure on Sixth avenue and Fifth street. John Newell, during the
years 1855 and 1856, erected a double brick structure at the corner of
Fifth street and Seventh avenue. The old Seabury house on Eighth avenue
was erected prior to 1860 and for many years was a landmark in that end
of town. The Barthel house which stood where the Majestic Theatre now
stands was one of the early brick veneer houses in the city and was
occupied by many of the prominent families from time to time.

R. C. Rock, one of the early merchants, erected a brick house in the
early days on the premises where George Williams has since erected a
magnificent mansion. Dr. Wilman, Dr. J. L. Enos and Dr. S. D. Carpenter
erected brick houses in the early days which were landmarks along
Second avenue up toward Tenth street. The Lawson Daniels brick
residence was on First avenue between Second and Third streets
adjoining the Thomas Building, and adjoining this was the dwelling of
Dr. Thomas, a friend of J. J. Snouffer and a native of Maryland; Dr.
Thomas returned to his native state in the '50s. Adjoining these brick
dwellings was also another brick building erected by the old pioneer H.
G. Angle and occupied by him as a residence for many years.

Another substantial brick dwelling was erected by John Graves on B
avenue and Fourth street, being a two-story brick building with an
upper and lower porch. The old Gillette house was on the east side of
Fifth street where William S. Bye now resides; it was known as the
Gillette house. Mr. Gillette being the brother-in-law of the late W. D.
Watrous.

Another large and commodious brick dwelling house was a two-story
structure erected on Fifth street between B and C avenues and near what
is known now as Whittam Park. Adjoining this was the Koontz house,
occupied by Dr. Koontz and his family for many years. The Tryon house
was also a brick structure erected near the corner of Third avenue and
Second street; Mr. Tryon was a surveyor and well known in the early
days.

Nearly all the brick used in the early days was made by a Mr. Geeslan
who operated a brick yard near what is now known as the "Lame Johnny"
place. Brick was cheap, labor was low and the cost of erecting these
dwellings in that day was much lower than later. It is said that Sam
Stambaugh in the early days worked as a brick mason and walked home to
Bertram every night, the wages paid being about $1.00 a day, which was
considered high. It is also said that during the '50s Cedar Rapids had
more commodious homes than any other town of its size in Iowa. It was
made up largely of a brainy, wide-awake, enterprising lot of men, such
as N. B. Brown, H. G. Angle, the Greenes, Earles, Elys, Daniels, Macks,
Weares, Bevers, and many others who had drifted into the town and who
soon built up an enterprising little town, engaging in various
ventures, not always successful, but they had Cedar Rapids before the
world so that they finally landed the railroad which henceforth made
the town. It is said by the late Charles Weare that "when they first
started a newspaper there were no settlers in the town, but they had to
use a newspaper to boom the town with."


SOME STRENUOUS DAYS IN THE OLDEN TIMES

FROM THE CEDAR RAPIDS REPUBLICAN, SUNDAY, JUNE 10, 1906

An ordinance creating a fire department was introduced in the council
in January, 1869, and it was passed February 12, 1869. This ordinance
was lengthy. It stipulated what officers should be appointed, what
their duties were, how many fire companies to each engine, how many men
to each company and many other details. One of the provisions of this
first and original ordinance was that the fire chief should be
appointed by the council.

On March 12, 1869, the fire company which had already been organized
but not officially recognized by the city council, presented a petition
to the council, asking that P. C. Lusk be appointed as fire chief. At a
subsequent meeting a vote was taken on the election of a fire chief
with the following result:

P. C. Lusk, who was the choice of the fire department, received four
votes and J. J. Snouffer one vote. Lusk having received a majority of
the votes cast was declared elected chief of the fire department. At
the meeting held April 9, 1869, the chief of the fire department
presented the names of the members of the first company which was
styled "The Steam Fire Engine Co., No. 1." It was organized under
Ordinance No. 78. Mr. Lusk reported the names of sixty members,
including officers, and asked the council to confirm them, which was
done.

The officers of this company were as follows:

     Foreman--Geo. A. Lincoln.
     Assistant Foreman--M. T. Bell.
     Secretary--E. W. S. Otto.
     Treasurer--W. B. Stewart.
     Hose Captain--D. A. Dingman.
     Assistant Hose Captain--N. H. Martin.
     Engineer--W. Berkley.
     Stoker--H. S. Gilmore.

Some of the "high privates" in this first organized fire company of
Cedar Rapids were as follows: Al Jacobs, Richard Cornish, C. E. Calder,
Lyman Ayers, Geo. Rhodes, Ed. Buttolph, John H. Smith, H. S. Bever, H.
E. Witwer, H. Hale, Geo. Hasse, John Bryan, Walter L. Clark, L. L.
Cone, Chas. L. Morehead, A. S. Mershon, Ely E. Weare, James Snyder,
John Shearer, Baxter McQuinn, W. J. Wood, Richard Moorhead, Don Harris,
Lowell Bressler, N. Rudolph, Ira Taft, and twenty-seven others.

[Illustration: MONTROSE HOTEL, CEDAR RAPIDS]

Early in April a hook and ladder company was organized and on April 16,
1869, was confirmed by the council as a part of the fire department of
Cedar Rapids. The officers of the company were as follows:

     Foreman--S. D. Fleck.
     First Assistant--J. S. Dickinson.
     Secretary--Geo. A. Gault.
     Recorder and Treasurer--J. G. Krebs.

Samuel A. Lilly. H. C. Morehead, James Fowler, P. C. Garrett, J. C.
Adams, Samuel Spalding, J. A. Hart, Joseph Lilly, J. M. Chambers, T.
Snook, J. J. Calder, G. M. Howlett, C. D. Pettibone and six others
constituted the active membership of this organization.

The official life of Chief Engineer Lusk was very brief and was marked
by continued strife and dissension among the members of the department.
He became _persona non grata_ to the council and charges were preferred
against him. July 13, 1869, Alderman Hill introduced a resolution
reciting that while the chief engineer could not be declared guilty of
intentional fraud he was indiscreet in many things and his influence
for good in the department had been so impaired that his resignation
was demanded. This did the business, and on July 23 he resigned. W. B.
Leach was appointed chief engineer for the remainder of the term, and
peace and good feeling prevailed in the department.

In March, 1870, after the inauguration of the new council of which W.
B. Leach was mayor, a petition of the fire department was presented in
which they asked the council to appoint Geo. A. Lincoln as chief
engineer of the department. Another petition was also presented, signed
by many citizens, asking that W. D. Watrous be appointed chief engineer
of the department. On the 25th of March, a ballot being ordered, Geo.
A. Lincoln received three votes and W. D. Watrous three votes,
whereupon the mayor voted for Lincoln and declared him elected to the
position of chief engineer, and on the 26th day of March he was duly
qualified and took the oath of office.

Shortly after Mr. Lincoln assumed the authority vested in the office of
chief engineer of the fire department, an element of discord arose in
the council and an effort was made to secure by legislation and
diplomacy what they had failed to accomplish when the vote was taken in
March.

It was thought the original ordinance passed in January, 1869, was
faulty and should be amended and the ordinance committee was directed
to make such amendments as were necessary or to prepare an entirely new
ordinance.

During the summer of 1870 the committee had prepared an ordinance which
was practically the same as the old one. The only radical change was in
the manner of electing a chief engineer. The new ordinance placed the
election of the officer with the electors after the year 1870 and a new
section was added which read as follows:

"No person shall be eligible to the office of chief engineer unless he
be a resident of said city at least one year and shall have attained
the age of twenty-five years."

To understand the force of this last clause in the ordinance it will be
necessary to remark that at this time Mr. Lincoln was only twenty-three
years old. This ordinance, the records say, was passed July 29, 1870,
but it was found necessary to amend it and it was not until ordinance
No. 98 was passed on September 30, 1870, that the council felt safe in
electing a new chief engineer to take the place of the one so skilfully
legislated out of office. On the 15th of October, 1870, A. R. West
became the chief engineer of the fire department by the vote of the
council. After the election of Mr. Lincoln during the spring and summer
of 1870 it was uncertain whether the city of Cedar Rapids had a fire
department or not, and it was also a question as to the authority
possessed by the chief. There was much discord and bitterness among
some of the members of the fire organizations. The city council was far
from being harmonious and rarely acted in unison in legislating for the
well being of the fire department. The citizens who had labored long
and earnestly in this work of procuring fire apparatus felt that they
had a right to demand that this bickering and personal contention
between the organized fire department and the duly elected city council
should be ended, but the strife continued. Early in the administration
of Mr. Lincoln as chief of the department a communication was presented
to the city council in which the petitioners, after recounting their
many grievances, made the claim that the election of Mr. Lincoln was
unparliamentary, unfair and contrary to the wishes of the department
and to a great majority of the property holders, and that while the
petitioners were willing to obey all ordinances of the city and the
ruling of any legally appointed officer as chief of the fire
department, they did not consider themselves lawfully bound to give any
heed or attention to the said Geo. A. Lincoln. That they as members of
the fire department would pay no attention to the said unlawfully
elected chief engineer nor to any order coming from him. This petition
was signed by Sam Neidig, C. W. Eaton, G. M. Howlett, Sam Lilly, Chas.
Hubbard, J. C. Adams, Thos. Snook, and fifteen others.

Some time later the chief engineer made a report to the city council as
the ordinance directed he should do, giving the necessary information
in regard to the efficiency of the department and its probable needs
for the future, but the council refused to accept it as the report of
the chief engineer, making the broad claim that there was no fire
department or a legally elected chief engineer and this was backed up
by the opinion of the city attorney. Mr. Lincoln, not to be thwarted by
the city council in refusing to listen to his report, was obliged to
have it published in the city papers and some extracts are made here,
showing the friendly feeling existing between him and some members of
the city council. He reported that the steam engine was in good shape
excepting that the grate had burned out and the committee on the fire
department had refused to get it repaired. The hose was poor and not in
condition to stand the pressure necessary in case of a large fire. This
was owing to the committee on fire refusing to have the tower on the
city hall arranged so the hose could be hung up to dry after having
been used. Many small bills for supplies used by the department, and
which were necessary for the running of the steamer, were hung up and
not allowed, and in speaking of the cistern which the city had built he
reports that one of the aldermen had the keys of the same and refused
to turn them over to him and as to the amount of water in same he could
make no report.

After the election of Mr. A. R. West to the position of chief engineer,
the old original No. 1 Fire Engine Company, or a large proportion of
its members, at one of its meetings passed the following resolution:

     "Whereas, The city council has seen proper to persecute and
     finally to declare us not an organized fire company, and

     "Whereas, We who compose the Fire Engine Company No. 1 have
     since organization labored faithfully to make the department
     as efficient as possible and have in all cases discharged
     our duties as firemen, therefore

     "Resolved, That we turn over to the city council all the
     fire apparatus in our possession. That we refuse to offer
     our services as firemen so long as any member of the city
     council who has been persistent in our persecution shall
     remain in said council.

     "Resolved, That we condemn the city council in thus
     deliberately and intentionally using their power to cripple
     and destroy the efficiency of the fire department.

     "Resolved, That we preserve our company organization and
     that each and every one refuse to touch, use or handle any
     of the fire apparatus belonging to the city of Cedar
     Rapids."

This old, original company, No. 1, was then a fire company to all
intents and purposes, acting under the original organization, with most
of the original members belonging, but they had no apparatus, no
engines, nothing to use in case of fire. But this did not long remain.
A subscription was started among the members of the company, and they
with the aid of their friends and citizens soon had subscribed a sum
sufficient to buy a substantial hand engine of a late pattern, together
with 5,000 feet of new hose, a new hose cart, and also to put up a
comfortable and neat engine house in which to hold their meetings and
to shelter their engine and the other necessary equipment.

This engine was purchased of Josiah Gates & Son, Lowell, Mass., and
cost the sum of $800, which amount was paid in cash from the proceeds
of the many subscriptions. It was called the E. S. Hill Independent
Fire Company, in honor of E. S. Hill who was the patron saint in all
their contentions with the city council, being an alderman from the
First ward, and also one of the most liberal subscribers to the fund to
procure the engine, he having led the subscription list with $200.00.

The hose cart was procured from Quincy, Ill., where it had been
previously used by that city, and cost $300.00 all complete. The hose
to the amount of 500 feet cost the sum of $500.00. The material for the
building of the engine house was obtained free from the local dealers
and the construction was almost all done by the members of the company.

After this company had procured their apparatus and were domiciled in
their new building they developed into a very aggressive company of
fire fighters, and it was the boast of some of its members that they
could get out to a fire, extinguish the flames and be ready to return
home before the steam engine company could get to the fire and be ready
to work.

A. R. West, who had been duly elected chief engineer of the fire
department, together with John T. Hamilton, who was appointed assistant
fire engineer, succeeded after much labor in bringing order out of the
chaos that had so long existed in the affairs of the fire department.

The steam engine, together with the hook and ladder equipment, was put
into the hands of a newly organized company, most of the members of
which had not been identified with any of the previous unpleasantness
between the council and the fire department.

For the next five years Cedar Rapids had two fire departments, the one
belonging to the city and under municipal control, and the other
denominated the "Independent," owning their own equipment and subject
to no official orders from the city.

This continued until the advent of the Cedar Rapids Water Co., who put
in their system of waterworks and established hydrants in all parts of
the city.


MRS. ROCK'S REMINISCENCES

Mrs. R. C. Rock, one of the earliest of the pioneers, is still living
in a serene and vigorous old age. She is a relative of Judge Greene,
and came west to Dubuque in 1849 at his request to assist him in
getting out his first volume of Iowa Reports, which was printed in New
York. She later came to Cedar Rapids with the judge and assisted
materially in getting ready for the press and in proof reading the
matter for the other volumes of his Reports. The members of the supreme
court would frequently gather in Cedar Rapids in chambers to prepare
their opinions and to O. K. them for publication. Mrs. Rock did much of
the law copying for these judges. Their decisions were turned over to
her to record and to edit for publication. She says Judge Williams was
flowery in his language and it became necessary to do a good deal of
trimming of his decisions so as to condense them properly before
publication, as attorneys were not so much interested in the language
of the court as they were in getting quickly at the meat of the
decisions. Mrs. Rock did not hesitate to do a great amount of pruning,
with the result that Judge Greene received many compliments over the
improvements noted in his second volume as compared with the matter
that appeared in the first publication.

For a time Mrs. Rock did editorial work on the _Progressive Era_, which
was published from the Greene Bros. building. J. O. Stewart was then
"devil" in the office, and many a time brought to her the proofs of her
contributions. The files of this early Linn county newspaper were
burned in a fire which destroyed the publication office, so that now
there are in existence but a few scattered issues. An early one was
given a few years ago to the Masonic Library by Mrs. Rock who found it
by accident among some of her effects.

Mrs. Rock came west by boat from Buffalo to Milwaukee, and then by
stage to Dubuque in 1849. The next year she removed to Cedar Rapids,
coming here by stage over the Old State Road laid out from Iowa City to
Dubuque by Engineer Barney of Washington, D. C. This road was a very
crooked one. His son, W. J. Barney, on being twitted about its many
windings replied that he believed his father was entirely sober when he
staked out the route, and that its numerous windings were necessary to
avoid the sloughs and swamps.

Mrs. Rock well remembers some of the trips she made on the old stage
from Dubuque to Cedar Rapids. It was customary to make 25 miles of the
journey the first day. On one trip on arriving at the usual stopping
place it was found impossible to obtain any hay for the weary horses.
After a further drive of five miles a stop was made at a farm cabin, it
being customary for the settlers at any place to provide entertainment
for travellers. Here they found feed for the horses, but they were told
there was no bread or flour in the house, the man not having returned
from the distant mill with his grist. There was some milk, and at last
a little flour or meal was discovered. The two were mixed and put in a
pan on the stove to cook. Unfortunately it was so badly burned that it
could not be eaten, and the travelers were compelled to go to bed
supperless. During the night the man returned with his grist, and Mrs.
Rock and party had a fairly good breakfast of saleratus biscuits and
pork.

One day while living in Cedar Rapids Mrs. Rock learned of the Spirit
Lake massacre. She states the people here for a time had a genuine
Indian scare, but nothing came of it.

Mrs. Rock has distinct recollections of prairie fires here. She says
they were beautiful but terrible to behold. They were especially
prevalent every fall on the west side, and many a time has she seen the
bright flames cover the hills that are now incorporated in the city of
Cedar Rapids. Judge Greene had early planted a large orchard at Mound
Farm, and once after it had borne fruit for a number of years it was
threatened with destruction from a prairie fire. All Cedar Rapids went
out to help fight the flames. They saved the orchard at this time, but
later the trees were killed by an unusually severe winter.

The ladies of Cedar Rapids were very patriotic during the war years.
They made all the uniforms for the boys of Col. T. Z. Cook's company,
and supplied them with generous quantities of bandages and lint. It
happened that after the severe engagement at Wilson's Creek those
bandages were the only ones available on the field. Mrs. Rock's
brother, then 18 years old, enlisted under Colonel Cook. After the
hundred days for which the company had entered the service he
re-enlisted under Captain Stibbs, being wounded at Ft. Donelson. He
then again entered the army under Captain Coulter, father of Ed.
Coulter now living in Cedar Rapids, and was later killed in the south.
Captain Coulter's company was known as the "Brindle Brigade," because
it was made up of men from so many regiments that had disbanded.

There were some lawless people among the earliest settlers, says Mrs.
Rock, and they occasionally appropriated a horse or two, necessitating
some corrective action by the community. On one occasion N. B. Brown
borrowed a horse from a man whose discipline was decreed and went to
Westport to secure tar for the purpose. At dusk the horse was returned
to the barn. C. C. Cook seized the individual, assisted by Gainor and
others. His legs were tied and he was taken to the side hill on B
avenue where his clothes were removed and he was treated to a coat of
tar and feathers. The following day he appeared among his fellows, and
my relator states there was "not even a smell of tar about him," but
the treatment proved effectual.

One of the early settlers, Joe Leverich, had a fine library, was a
great reader, a shrewd observer of human character, and his descendants
are people of intelligence and high morality. Among those who came
later were Dr. J. F. Ely and Dr. S. D. Carpenter in 1849, Judge Greene
in 1850. They were men of education and attainment. Soon followed Miss
Legare of Washington, D. C., the Bryans, and Stoneys from Charleston,
S. C., A. S. Belt, a lawyer, son of Commodore Belt, of Maryland, the
Taylors from Virginia, and many others whose character and culture gave
moral and mental tone to the growing community. In religious
intercourse a broad and kindly feeling characterized all, and now in
1910, the same feeling prevails. The Daniels brothers erected a store,
three stories, where the Masonic Temple now stands. In 1849 the Green
Brothers erected a three-story brick building diagonally across, the
first floor being used for merchandizing, the second for Judge Greene's
office and ware rooms. In one large room in this building Miss Calder,
from New York, opened a school for girls in the fall of 1850. In a hall
on the third floor, a Masonic lodge was organized the same year. Miss
Calder [Mrs. Rock] drew designs for the emblems and attended to making
the aprons.

The first district school house was built several years previous on the
lot on Second avenue and Fifth street. The Cedar Rapids Business
College is now located on this site. This was used also for religious
services on Sunday. Squire Abbe's daughter taught the first school, and
Miss Louisa Roberts, daughter of the Congregational minister, the
second. Squire Abbe was a member of the Territorial Legislature.

Miss Calder's school prospered; and two other teachers were secured;
one from New York for the piano, and another, Miss Parkhurst, to assist
in the English branches. She was a recent graduate from Miss Sill's
seminary at Rockford, Illinois. Miss Calder herself continued with some
of the English grades, also with French and Drawing. Pupils were
attracted from neighboring towns, Marion, Vinton, Dubuque, Muscatine,
Burlington, Fairfield, etc., but after a few years, failing health
caused her to relinquish it to two young ladies from Ohio, and within
two years it ceased to exist. The following year Miss Calder married R.
C. Rock, a hardware merchant. About the same date the Rev. Williston
Jones, Presbyterian minister, opened a school for boys in his private
residence, and after a few months turned it over to Mr. Blakeley, when
it was transferred to the "Little Muddy" church. Mr. Blakeley's public
examination was the occasion of a lampoon by Dr. S. D. Carpenter, but
he was a fine man and a good teacher. Geo. E. W. Leonard was financial
agent for this school.

These efforts resulted in Rev. Mr. Jones securing from Daniel Coe, of
Green county, New York, a gift of $1,000.00 with which was purchased
eighty acres of land adjoining the town, a part of which is now
occupied by Coe College and from which numerous lots were sold to aid
in establishing this school. The first college building was erected by
subscription of the citizens. The only surviving incorporator of the
institution is Dr. Seymour D. Carpenter, now residing in Chicago, aged
about eighty-four.

The first religious services were Methodist, held in the district
school house, and their circuit riders came every two weeks. They
organized a Sunday school and insisted on a union school. The
Presbyterians, New School, effected the first organization in 1847 in
Mr. Vardy's shop, corner Third street and Sixth avenue. They, too,
worshiped in the school house. Dr. Ely read the sermons, but their
first minister, Mr. Roberts, of Marion, was a Congregationalist. He was
succeeded by Rev. W. Jones, before mentioned. The first Episcopal
clergyman was Rev. James Keeler, who found an occasional opening for
service in the school house, but soon came to using Miss Calder's
school room for regular Sunday service.


WHEN LAND WAS DIRT CHEAP IN CEDAR RAPIDS

Real estate investments have always been successful and profitable in
Cedar Rapids, and probably will always continue to be so. As shown in
other articles, the land upon which Cedar Rapids is built was
originally owned by five men, Judge Greene, Nicholas Brown, Addison
Daniels, Wm. Sanford, and Alexander Ely. The division of the property
was made in 1849 as is shown elsewhere, and it is from that time that
most of the real estate transfers were made. All the gentlemen made
fortunes from their speculations.

How these five gentlemen came to be possessed of all the land in the
city of Cedar Rapids would make an interesting story, especially if the
prices they paid for each lot could be secured. They doubtless bought
up the claims for almost nothing. We get some inkling of how the lots
came into their possession by a curious old document which was
deposited by Mr. C. G. Greene with the curator of the museum for the
semi-centennial week.

The property mentioned in it is the Grand Hotel corner, and this is a
copy of it:

     "Received, Cedar Rapids, Sept. 7, 1848, of John L. Shearer,
     one yoke of oxen valued at thirty-five dollars, in full for
     Lot 9 in block No. 23 in the town of Cedar Rapids.

                                                   "Geo. Greene."

But it appears that Judge Greene did not think he had a very great
bargain, for only seven months later, in May of the following year, the
county records show that this same lot upon which the Grand Hotel now
stands, and forty feet additional, 120x150 feet in all, was sold by
Judge Greene back to John L. Shearer for $75. Up to 1865 it passed
through several hands, with slightly increased value, when it was sold
by Henry McBride to Charles Weare for $1,100. Weare sold immediately to
S. B. Fleek for $1,500, and Fleek sold it in 1871 to E. M. Greene for
$9,000. In 1877 Greene sold 80x140 feet to John T. Waterhouse for
$10,000, and this property which originally brought $75, could not now
be purchased, if unimproved, for less than $100,000. It is now held by
a syndicate.

William Stewart originally owned the ground where the Cook & Laurance
store used to be located. He traded an Indian pony for it in the early
days, and held it until 1873, when he sold it for $7,500.

The property upon which the Calder buildings now stand, 60x140 feet,
was also originally owned by Judge Greene. He sold it to Alexander Ely,
who sold it to Harvey Higley and Samuel Hook, and they in turn sold it,
in 1850, to Frederick Miles for $82. Miles held it until 1875, when he
sold it for $1,500. Mr. Calder's friends told him at the time that he
was throwing his money away, but now it doesn't look that way, as the
land unimproved would sell for many times that sum.

Where the Golden Eagle store is now located, 60x140 feet was sold in
1848 by James M. Berry to Homer Bishop for $150. After passing through
several hands the ground was purchased by P. Mullally and W. W. and M.
A. Higley, who, in 1874, sold 60x140 feet of it to John T. Waterhouse
for $12,300.

The ground where George A. Mullin's store is located, 120x140 feet, was
sold by Mary A. Ely in 1853, to D. M. McIntosh, for $350. H. G. Angle
bought it in 1854 for $600. It was afterwards taken by creditors, and
was held by them until 1875, when it was sold to J. T. Waterhouse for
$13,000.

These are cases illustrative of the wonderful growth in the value of
Cedar Rapids real estate. It will of course some day find its level,
and will very probably go above it, but it is quite safe to say that
just now it is worth all that is paid for it.

Every time a real estate transfer is made it is amusing to get an "old
citizen" started, and have him bemoan his failure to invest a few
dollars in a block or so twenty years ago, and hold on to it until the
present time. If he had done so he would have been rich--but the
trouble is he didn't do it.

Thomas McGregor, who was working for a Mr. Robinson in the fifties, was
offered lots where the Quaker Oats plant is now located at $10 a lot,
but needed the money to keep his family on as he got only 75 cents per
day.

On arrival of the first steamer in Cedar Rapids lots were offered free
to passengers and crew in case they wanted to locate. Many lots were
given away by real estate boomers in those days to increase the
population of the city. Many of these lots were later lost because the
owners thought so little of their value that they let them go to tax
sales.

Property on Second avenue between Second and Fourth streets was then
only residence property, sand hills, and the like. Now all of this has
become valuable business property and is held at not less than $1,000 a
front foot, and still going higher. These lots were sold less than
fifty years ago at $25 a lot.

Property on Third avenue was even less valuable than property on Second
avenue. With the location of the station here with the hotels, bank
buildings, etc., lots are now selling at fabulous prices. With the
advance of prices rents have also advanced. I. C. Emery some twenty
years ago had the same location which he has recently gone into, and
paid at that time about one-third of the rent he pays today. Rents on
the ground floor in the Kimball building, the Ely block, the Dows
block, and in others of the old buildings have gradually advanced in
accordance with the advance in prices of the real estate holdings, and
pretty much in the same ratio.

Large office buildings have been erected from time to time, and it has
been said that the city would never demand such quarters. It has only
been a little time till there has been a demand for more office and
store buildings on a larger scale and these have been filled without
any trouble.

The property where is located the Denecke building was once used for a
livery stable, and the property on which is located the Magnus block
was occupied as a dwelling house. These properties were traded back and
forth for a song. The O'Haras finally snapped them up and began
improvement and were thought at the time to be crazy. Mr. Denecke then
began purchasing and the same was said of him. When Mr. Magnus made his
purchase of the block in 1894, during the depression, they said he
would never get his money out of it. Today he has been offered more
than twice what he paid and refuses to consider the offer. The corner
where the Security bank is now located had been sold and re-sold, and
no one thought it worth anything, and when G. F. Van Vechten purchased
a few feet for a bank location many years ago the people of the town
still thought it impossible that this corner would be worth so much.
The bank later had to pay a handsome price in order to get ground
enough to make the improvements desired, and would have made money by
having bought much earlier. The Taft building was purchased by the
late Judge Hubbard some ten years ago at $55,000, and is now worth
twice that sum.

However old settlers say that for years real estate in Cedar Rapids did
not move and it was a drug on the market, and the rents were not in
ratio with the values. For years town lots were peddled about the town
and traded for stocks of goods, for old horses, and other personal
property, and it was always thought that the person who obtained the
real estate got the poor end of the bargain.

William Stone, Osgood Shepherd, Thomas Gainer, David King, H. G. Angle,
and others of the early settlers did not know what a mine they
possessed had they only hung on long enough. Stone settled on the Iowa
river and later left for Wisconsin, and Shepherd soon followed, all
thinking he had made a good thing by selling his squatter rights to
Brown and his friends.

Dr. E. L. Mansfield arrived in Cedar Rapids in 1847, going overland to
California in 1850. He traded the west one-half of the block between
Third and Second avenues west, and between First and Second streets for
a rifle, which was considered a high price in those days. On this lot
Dr. Mansfield erected a large dwelling house and lived there for many
years. He purchased the lot on which the Whelihan drug store now stands
for $600, and the lot adjoining many years later for $10,000, at what
was then considered a very high price. Thus the property of 140 feet
fronting on Second street and 120 feet fronting on Second avenue were
purchased for less than $12,000, property which is now some of the most
valuable in Cedar Rapids. Dr. Mansfield also held part of the property
which was later purchased by the Cedar Rapids Savings Bank, and was
held by him up to the time of his death. This had been purchased at an
early day at low prices, when it was nothing but the cheapest kind of
renting property.

A. C. Taylor, holder of much valuable real estate in Cedar Rapids,
first owned the property where the First Christian church now stands.
He also purchased the property on First avenue near the Union block.
Mr. Taylor is the second oldest merchant in Cedar Rapids, and has not
moved more than a block from the time he came here to locate in part of
the postoffice on the alley where the Masonic Temple now stands. In
speaking of rents, Mr. Taylor says that he has been surprised at the
way rents have gone up year by year.

Osgood Shepherd, of whom it is said that he jumped Wilbert Stone's
claim, held this claim till 1847, when he disposed of his squatter
interest in what became Cedar Rapids to N. B. Brown, George Greene, H.
W. Gray, A. L. Roach, and S. H. Tryon for the sum of $3,000.


FIRST DECORATION DAY CELEBRATION IN CEDAR RAPIDS

FROM THE CEDAR RAPIDS REPUBLICAN, SUNDAY, JUNE 3, 1906

When was the first Decoration Day celebration in Cedar Rapids? That is
a question which many might find it hard to answer, and the story of
the preparations for that day and of the day itself is so interesting
that it is well worth a place here. There were comparatively few graves
to decorate on that occasion. Not many of those who fought in the war
had passed over the great divide in the year 1873, more than thirty
years ago. Men whose heads are silvered and their steps trembling were
then young and they marched firmly to the cemetery to take part in the
exercises on that first Decoration Day. Since that time many of them
have been laid beneath the sod and their comrades have done for them
what they helped to do for others.

The day was made memorable by an eloquent and beautiful address by the
late Judge Hubbard, a man who always loved the flag and the men who
fought for it. Patriotism was one of the subjects that always lay
nearest his heart.

The first meeting to arrange for the Decoration Day exercises was held
May 8, 1873. The Cedar Rapids _Daily Republican_ of the following
morning has the following interesting account of the meeting:

     "The meeting called for the purpose of taking measures to
     suitably observe Decoration Day, took place at the City Hall
     last night.

     "It was called to order by A. D. Collier, Esq., upon whose
     motion J. H. B. Otto was elected president of the meeting.

     "On motion of Hiel Hale, A. N. Neidig was chosen secretary.

     "On motion of Mr. Collier, a committee of five was appointed
     to recommend names to the meeting for the various committees
     to be appointed to make preparations for that day.

     "The following persons were selected as said committee:

     "A. D. Collier, Geo. A. Lincoln, D. A. Dingman, P. H.

     "Music, C. Ferguson, Mr. Baxter and Dr. Bliss.

     "On general arrangements, W. B. Leach, J. F. Charles, Ed.
     Thompson, L. M. Ayers, P. H. Francis, W. W. Smith, A. D.
     Collier, A. H. Neidig, and C. Ferguson.

     "On motion of Capt. Wm. B. Leach, Captain Otto, as the last
     commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, was instructed
     to call a meeting of the soldiers and sailors of this
     vicinity to have them meet and consult with regard to the
     part they shall take in the observance of the day.

     "On motion adjourned."

The program of that first Decoration Day was as follows:

     "The following programme will be observed on Decoration Day:

     "President of the day--Col. W. B. Leach.

     "Chief Marshal--Col. T. Z. Cook.

     "At ten o'clock a. m. the procession will form on the corner
     of Iowa avenue and Commercial street in wagons, and headed
     by the band, will proceed to the cemetery on the west side,
     where the graves will be decorated, and after which an
     oration will be delivered by Col. S. H. Henderson.

     "At two o'clock the procession will form on Iowa avenue, the
     right resting on Commercial street.

     "The following will be the order.

     "Music.

     "1. Grand Army of Republic.

     "2. Independent Fire Company.

     "3. Bohemia Society.

     "4. Hook and Ladder Company.

     "5. Odd Fellows.

     "6. Fire Company Steamer.

     "7. Citizens on foot.

     "8. Carriages.

     "Line of march will be down Commercial street to Eagle, up
     Eagle to Madison, down Madison to Greene street, thence to
     Oak Hill Cemetery, where the graves will be decorated, after
     which an oration will be delivered by Hon. Col. N. M.
     Hubbard.

     "All soldiers and citizens in the vicinity are cordially
     requested to be present, and assist in paying respect to our
     honored dead.

     "Soldiers will leave the number of their regiment at the
     _Times_ office and they will be furnished with a badge to
     wear on the occasion."

Following is the account of the exercises of that day with the text of
the address delivered by Judge Hubbard. It is taken from the _Daily
Republican_ of May 31, 1873:

     "Decoration Day has come and gone. It brought with it the
     noble thought to honor the heroic dead of our land, and left
     thousands of green graves strewn with choicest flowers of
     spring. This kindly and befitting token of love and honor
     was placed on every soldier's grave, to show how green and
     fresh in our hearts are the memories of their noble deeds.
     This day is one of mixed sorrow and pleasure--sad for the
     heavy sacrifices that had to be made, but happy to keep
     green the sacred memories of those who fell for their
     country's good.

     "The soldiers and sailors, who have died to save the
     nation's life, will never be forgotten so long as flowers
     are strewn upon the quiet graves beneath whose verdant
     mounds those gallant hearts lie stilled forever.

     "It is the sum of mortal glory for posterity to gather
     around the tombs of fallen heroes, as around holy shrines,
     and pour out their libations in songs, prayers and in
     fitting words of praise on their noble lives and gallant
     deeds.

     "The day opened yesterday morning with a rain storm, which
     continued more or less until about ten o'clock. It looked
     discouraging indeed, and many hearts felt sad at the
     uninviting prospect.

     "At eleven o'clock a few persons gathered on the west side
     and proceeded to the cemetery on that side of the river, and
     spent a short time in decorating the graves of a few
     soldiers that lie buried there. Rev. S. H. Henderson spoke a
     few moments on the importance of the occasion when the
     company dispersed and returned to their homes.

     "By noon the clouds had cleared away and the sun shone forth
     beautifully. At half past 2 o'clock Washington street in the
     vicinity of the City Hall was crowded with a large number of
     people who were listening to the fine strains of music that
     the Ferguson band were discoursing. About three o'clock the
     procession began to move, and in pretty much the same order
     as has already been published in the _Republican_. Between
     seventy-five and a hundred carriages, buggies, and wagons
     were in the procession, preceded by many footmen; also a
     number were on horseback. It was one of the most brilliant
     occasions of the kind that was ever witnessed in Cedar
     Rapids.

     "JUDGE HUBBARD'S ADDRESS

     "Judge Hubbard's address was so fine that we reproduce it
     entire. He spoke as follows:

     "My Countrymen, and Comrades of the Army of the Union:

     "Courage and bravery always challenge admiration, but when
     combined with exalted patriotism, they command the affection
     and gratitude of mankind.

     "The highest earthly care of man is to preserve as long as
     possible this life, and therefore the greatest human
     sacrifice is to give this life for one's country.

     "History is full of examples of this sacrifice in all time,
     and yet its frequency has never lessened the appreciation of
     it.

     "Patriotism--love of country, makes a great nation possible.
     Without it men would live isolated, or in mere tribes, and
     powerless.

     "The intellectual development of man shows him at once how
     weak and insignificant he is alone, and he seeks, by a
     combination of great numbers, to attain not only great power,
     but even immortality. We all know that our own lives are
     short, but the life of a nation may be so long, that we are
     apt to make delusion that it may be immortal, real.

     "The natural love and anxiety we have for our children, who
     are to live after us, extend to and embrace the country and
     the government in which they are to live.

     "Hence, we may be said to have two lives, an individual and a
     national one; and the latter commands the former in
     proportion to its increased span. We value everything
     somewhat in proportion to its power to last.

     "The study and contemplation of the national life, of which
     we are a part is always a matter of interest and solicitude.

     "On every hand men are seemingly wholly engaged in devising
     and planning for their individual prosperity and happiness,
     and silently but surely national prosperity and greatness
     follow these individual efforts. It is only when the nation
     stands in immediate peril, that we become aware how much
     greater our anxiety is for it, than even for ourselves.

     "You who can recall the thrill of horror, of anxiety, and of
     grim determination that came over you when the news first
     came that Sumter was fired upon, and the Stars and Stripes
     were shot away, can tell, but I can not describe what
     boundless sacrifices the national life is capable of calling
     forth.

     "How quick we found what a pride and what an interest we had
     in the magnitude, power, and prosperity of our country, and
     how firmly we were attached to its beneficent government.

     "The history of modern civilization in Europe has shown a
     constant struggle for many years for what they call the
     balance of power.

     "Five leading nations, speaking five different languages, and
     having different modes of thought and life, have watched and
     emulated each other, and each at times has had the reputation
     of being the most powerful. Fifty years ago France was
     foremost, today Prussia is the first power in Europe. These
     changes may be traced almost indefinitely.

     "In all the past, the national life, the national pride has
     grown with the growth of civilization.

     "It would be impossible that a nation should become great or
     powerful without a national self-love that wrought glowing
     pictures of its manifest destiny.

     "We find ourselves possessed of a country whose productive
     extent is far greater than all Europe, with its 300 million
     population, put together.

     "Beginning a little less than a hundred years ago with a
     population of three million, it has doubled every twenty-five
     years, if we shall reach forty-eight million in 1875, which
     scarcely admits of a doubt. The whole emigration added is
     less than six million.

     "At the same rate of increase for the next one hundred years
     our population will reach the enormous figures of seven
     hundred and sixty-eight millions. But suppose we shall touch
     the resistance, namely the lack of territory to supply so
     great a population with food; yet we may safely estimate
     reaching five hundred million, and the population equally
     distributed will then be about equal in density to the
     present population of Massachusetts.

     "I have neither time nor is it necessary to describe the
     variety of climate embracing the tropic and the temperate
     zones, nor the vastness, nor the fertility, nor the mineral
     and coal resources of our country.

     "Thus far nothing is problematical, but the people of future
     America are a study.

     "We know how sturdy and enduring the Anglo-Saxon is, how
     volatile yet tenacious is the Frenchman, how sober, solid and
     unwavering is the German, and how hardy and everlasting are
     the people who inhabit with the Polar bear. These are
     American now, but the Ethiopian and the Asiatic are to be
     added. The Star of Empire from the East and from the West
     have met upon the American continent. I believe the original
     Anglo-Saxon trunk will sustain all these grafts and that a
     nation will come of us by the cross of all civilized people
     that will be as superior to any of them, as the grafted fruit
     is superior to that of the seeding. Future America will be
     fitly symbolized by the Lion and the Polar Bear, surmounted
     by the American Eagle.

     "With one country, one language, one hope, one aspiration,
     bent sublimely upon achieving the highest intelligence,
     virtue, and culture that man can ideal, diffused through a
     population of five hundred million people, inhabiting
     one-quarter of the habitable earth with a republican
     government, is a spectacle that the world has never yet seen,
     but is to see through us and our children.

     "And but for these sacred graves, which we, and all the
     people throughout the land, have come today to crown with
     wreaths of flowers, no such hope, no such picture of the
     future of our country would be possible.

     "The future destiny of the American absolutely demanded that
     the fundamental idea of the Declaration of Independence
     should be made true, and that Liberty (in fact, as in name)
     should be proclaimed throughout all the land to all the
     inhabitants thereof, and also, that the United States should
     be one and inseparable forever.

     "Need I tell you how bravely and how well the army of the
     Union settled these questions? The men who lie silent beneath
     our feet and their comrades, have taught the South, and Great
     Britain, and the world, that the belt of country usually
     known as the North is the heart and power of the Republic. It
     is the strong arm that pushes the car of civilization in the
     new world. It is the second Defender of the faith of our
     Forefathers. It has fought the good fight, and many of its
     bravest sons have gone to their reward.

     "The Republic is emancipated, impartial suffrage and equality
     before the law established, and the work of regeneration is
     left for us and our posterity.

     "During all the long struggle which literally ridged the
     country with graves like these, there was everywhere present,
     through the ranks of the grand army, an abiding faith in the
     future greatness of their country, and in the final triumph.
     No soldier ever despaired of the Republic.

     "We come today to crown their valor by decorating their
     graves. What great eulogy can we pronounce upon them?

     "These silent graves are more eloquent than the tongues of
     the living. Their deeds commemorate their fame and their
     names do live after them.

     "As we meet year after year to perform this ceremony of love
     and gratitude to our fallen comrades, new graves will be
     added and new obligations will rest upon us, until the last
     soldier of the Army of the Union is laid to rest.

     "When that day comes, let us trust that the national life and
     prosperity that has cost so much to maintain and defend, will
     be inestimably dear to our children, and that they may fully
     realize all the hopes and aspirations of our forefathers and
     the second Defenders of the faith. If we shall not be
     disappointed in this, the 30th day of May will be as sacred
     as the 4th of July.

     "But new trials and new perils await us. Poverty is the home
     of virtue, and riches the abode of vice. The Republic has
     passed the age of poverty, and is approaching the age of
     wealth--always the sure accumulation of generations. Rome
     withstood all her enemies from without and within, but the
     corruption following in the train of her conquests overcame
     her.

     "If Heaven permits departed heroes still to know and watch
     over our beloved country, what anxious prayers are being made
     now, lest the blessing which the hand of their forefathers
     have left shall be wasted by the political dissension,
     frauds, corruptions, and wealth of coming generations! It is
     not fitting that I should name here and now what you all know
     so well and deplore. But may I not ask that we consecrate
     ourselves anew over these sacred graves, and resolve that our
     remaining days shall add something to the purity, patriotism,
     and lustre of our country that has been vouchsafed to us
     through the blood of these martyrs of liberty.

     "But whatever of adversity or misfortune may be in store for
     us as a nation, the fault in no way rests upon these graves.
     Their services and their fame are secure.

     "And today also the graves of the Confederate dead are
     decorated and strewn with flowers. It is a deserved tribute
     to their valor and patriotism. They had been educated to
     believe that the South alone was the nation. We believed and
     knew that the nation was from ocean to ocean and from the
     gulf to the lakes. But it was half slave and half free.

     "Today it is all free, and fifty years hence, if our hopes of
     the future of the Republic are realized, the South and North
     will rejoice in a common joy, that 'Union and Liberty' have
     been so signally preserved to them and their posterity
     forever.

     "And while we wreath flowers for these graves, let us not
     forget to return thanks and give honor to the brave seamen
     who guarded our coasts, and let the 'Father of Waters go
     unvexed to the sea.'

     "And the widow and orphan of the soldier and sailor, let them
     be remembered with blessings, with charity and with thanks.
     All they have left them for their great sacrifice is their
     country and its gratitude. Let these be generous and
     unsparing.

     "And still again let us not forget the brave men and women
     who fed and clothed all, who nursed and cared for the sick
     and wounded, who cheered and encouraged all with patriotic
     deeds and words. And finally, and above all, let us thank God
     who gave us the victory, whereby it has become possible that
     the Stars and Stripes float over an unbroken emancipated
     Republic, strong enough to maintain its existence against all
     foes, and yet without power to abridge the liberties of the
     humblest citizen."


FIRST LOCAL LABOR UNION ORGANIZED IN THE CITY

FROM CEDAR RAPIDS REPUBLICAN, JUNE, 1906

It was in 1882 that an agitation was instituted in the city of New
York, in which all the great labor organizations of the United States
took part, and out of which grew the setting apart of Labor Day as a
day of recognition of the cause of labor. It was not until 1887,
however, that the germ thus planted gave fruit. On February 21, 1887,
the state of Oregon passed a law setting aside the first Saturday in
June for the observance of the cause of labor, and six years later the
first Monday in September was chosen by the same state. That day has
been observed ever since. The second state to legalize the holiday was
New Jersey, and in May of the following year New York passed a similar
law, Colorado and Massachusetts soon followed. In 1890 many of the
other states passed acts recognizing the day. West Virginia and North
Carolina were far behind the rest in this regard and did not legalize
the day until 1899.

The first great labor demonstration was held in New York city in 1882
and the parade which took place on that day is still remembered as an
event of unusual magnitude. All the labor organizations of the city
were in line and with their splendid floats, banners, etc., they made
an imposing spectacle.

The following year it was determined to repeat, if possible, the parade
of 1882, which had come to be termed "The Labor Day Parade." This time
the date was changed to the first Monday in September and when in 1884
the discussion of a repetition of the occasion came up, George B. Floyd
offered a resolution in the Central Labor Union convention to the
effect that the first Monday in September be declared Labor Day. The
resolution was unanimously adopted and at the next session of the
legislature a bill was introduced declaring Labor Day a legal holiday.
There was considerable objection to the measure, however, and it was
not until 1887 that a majority in its favor could be rallied together.

With the day recognized by the legislature of New York and two other
states a concerted effort was made to secure action by the various
labor organizations throughout the country, and in a few years the
majority of the states had declared in its favor.

Curiously enough the original Labor Day was just after the organization
of the first local in this city, which the "old residents" say is
Typographical Union No. 192. There may be some objection to this claim
on the part of some of the present members of the typographical union.
The charter of the Typographical Union local is now hanging in the K.
P. hall, and it is dated December 26, 1881. Unless challenged the
members of the Typographical Union will claim the honor of being the
first organization of union labor in the city of Cedar Rapids. The
charter bears the names of the following charter members:

C. M. Hopkins, George S. Bradley, Harry Ingalls, J. D. Canan, L. C.
Hay, L. B. Kramer, J. H. Enos.

If the memory of Sam Snouffer is correct the local was organized among
the employees of the _Republican_ office and it was a local of
newspaper printers only. Sam says that he was a job printer at the time
and the boys on the cases who organized the local didn't at first allow
job printers to hold membership in their organizations. He says that
the local was organized for a fight and it had it at frequent intervals
during the early part of its history. But it grew and flourished and
today the Typographical Union Local in Cedar Rapids is recognized as a
conservative, yet aggressive body of men, with the courage to ask for
its rights and the level headedness to get those rights without
trouble.


THE STORY OF A MOUNTAIN HOWITZER

During the war when the boys were about to return home they sought to
carry back mementoes of the long struggle. Company E of the Twelfth
Iowa as a trophy of the war picked up a mountain howitzer which had
been captured by the rebels and re-captured by the United States
troops. Some members of Company D of the Twelfth Iowa then, by some
means known only to the soldier boys, unlawfully laid claim to the
cannon and Homer Morehead, one of the old Cedar Rapids boys, was able
to get the cannon as far as Davenport, the city council of Cedar Rapids
providing means to get it to Cedar Rapids.

The cannon, a two hundred pounder, was used freely by every
organization for a number of years whenever any celebration took place.
During the Grant campaign, in October of that year, the republicans had
a blow-out and the cannon was used; in this celebration the cannon was
slightly damaged and was hauled down to John Mehan's for repairs. While
there some person, or persons, saw fit to take it in the night time and
nothing was heard of it for many years. A note was tacked up to the
wall where the cannon had been left for repairs to the effect that it
would be returned and shot off when a democratic president was
inaugurated. The soldier boys and many of the prominent citizens of
Cedar Rapids were very much stirred up over this affair and publicly
accused a number of prominent Cedar Rapids democratic citizens of
stealing the cannon, but no one, at least who was publicly accused,
admitted having anything to do with it.

The incident was nearly forgotten when Cleveland was elected, the first
democratic president since the Civil war. One morning as Harry Brown
was walking down the street John Mehan called to him to come over and
see what he had found. There, sure enough, was the same old mountain
howitzer cleaned up and in first class repair, with a note tied to it
that it was returned as agreed and would be ready for action in due
time. This affair stirred up the republican camp once more and threats
were made that this cannon would never be shot off to celebrate a
democratic victory, and it never was.

It now remains as a relic in the old postoffice building, and many are
the citizens of Linn county who have inspected this little cannon and
have heard the story told by the old settlers.

Not until a short time ago was it definitely known who removed the
cannon from the Mehan shop in 1868. A Center Point person had been
accused of having something to do with it; how true this is no one
knows. It is thought that two young men in the employ of N. B. Brown, a
stanch democrat, took the cannon and placed it in the stable owned by
O. P. Emery which stood on the ground where the Denecke building now
stands. Mr. Emery no doubt knew of the whereabouts of the cannon, and
when he removed up on Second avenue a heavy box was moved by workmen
supposed to contain tools. When Mr. Emery removed to the home of his
son-in-law, John B. Henderson, on First avenue, the same heavy box was
once more moved. Mrs. John B. Henderson noticed that her father, after
the election of Cleveland, spent several days in the barn working
steadily polishing up some iron, but she never inquired what he was
doing or what he wanted to accomplish. A short time before his death
O. P. Emery admitted to his daughter that while he did not remove the
cannon he knew of its whereabouts and had some of his intimate friends
restore it to the Mehan shop after Cleveland's election as it had been
agreed in the letter or note left the night of the capture of the
cannon when no one was around to watch this much prized treasure.


A FORTUNATE TUMBLE

Linn county during the Civil war had its share of so-called
"copperheads," as well as a goodly number of loyal sympathizers known
as "fire eaters." During this period of our country's history many
unfortunate affairs occurred of which all parties ever afterwards were
ashamed. In a state where the majority was strong in favor of the war
measure it behooved those who were against this measure not to say too
much. Frequently innocent people had to suffer for the acts of some one
who talked openly and above board, not only against the president but
against those who were instrumental in sending troops to the front.
Democrats in the north were classed by the republicans as follows:
Those who went to the front as loyal democrats, and those who stayed at
home as "copperheads," although they may have been otherwise
law-abiding citizens.

On the morning that news was received of the assassination of Lincoln
Cedar Rapids became a town of turmoil and strife. Never in the history
of the town had excitement run so high. The question of another war was
discussed in saloons and on street corners, and during the entire day
this strife was kept up. Towards evening a story got started that Bill
Harper, a well-known anti-war democrat and a person who had frequently
when intoxicated said some pretty mean things of the republicans in
general, said "that he was glad that Lincoln got killed; that he should
have been shot four years ago." The story spread like a western wild
fire, and in less than an hour it was all over town. A crowd got
together and it was not long till a self-appointed committee was
organized for the sole purpose of hanging Bill Harper to a rafter or a
sour apple tree at sight and without trial. A good sized rope was
procured and the yelling crowd, headed by the late I. N. Whittam and
others, made for the store room kept by Brown & Harper, on what is now
North First street. That Harper was a well-known and outspoken
so-called "copperhead" was universally known and no question arose in
the minds of the mob as to the truth or falsity of the charge. A few in
the party uttered remarks that there might be a mistake and that there
ought to be some investigation to bear out the facts before the rope
was applied, but the majority ruled and these faint-hearted fellows
were laughed to scorn. N. B. Brown, who had heard of the trouble and
who was a partner of Harper, got into the store building, mounted a
barrel and talked to the crowd, claiming that Harper could not have
said the words with which he was charged, for he had not been in town
for several days. Squire Knowles, a republican and a believer in fair
play, tried to persuade the mob to disperse, but his plea found little
favor with a mob who insisted on a hanging. Then Bill Darr, a neighbor
of Harper, also a republican, had to come to the front and tell what he
knew about Harper. He said that Harper had been at home near Bertram
and had been sick in bed for several days, and that he had been to his
house and called on him the day before and he was certain that Harper
knew nothing of what had taken place at the national capital. Darr was
not treated any better than the others and was called "traitor" and all
sorts of names because he wanted to save his neighbor's life if
possible.

[Illustration: A. BOWMAN]

[Illustration: E. M. CROW]

[Illustration: J. M. MAY]

Many of the crowd had been drinking heavily and insisted that something
be done, and if they could not do any better they ought to fire the
building and burn up the whole thing, while Brown insisted that most of
the property was his and that he would vouch for his partner's honor
and reputation as far as that charge went. Whittam by this time had
gotten over the blood curdling period of his leadership and was willing
to turn the job over to other hands, but no one seemed willing to come
to his rescue, and there was no opportunity to put a motion for an
adjournment till the violence and the temper of the mob would somewhat
abate. Brown wanted to hold the mob as long as possible, having in the
meantime sent messengers to notify Harper of what might happen. He
realized that the infuriated mob at that stage of the game might hang
an innocent man.

Just at this point of the delicate proceedings, the crowd yelling like
warlike Indians, and threatening to hang any "copperhead" and to burn
the building provided Harper was not brought into the room, a fourteen
year old boy, long, lank and lean, who had also crowded into the
building wanting to see what was going on, and to get more air, climbed
on top of a hogshead which stood in one corner of the room. As he was
gazing out over the crowd others tried to get on to the same hogshead,
pushing and pulling, when suddenly the end gave way and the boy fell
into a mass of lard and dye stuff up to his neck. The stench acted like
morphine upon the infuriated mob. Someone called for the rope to pull
the boy out and then a general laugh broke out and when the boy ran
down through the crowd, dripping with lard and lye, making for the
river, the panic became general and they all followed his movements and
forgot all about Bill Harper or the words he was supposed to have
uttered.

The boy who thus saved the day and perhaps a life or two is no other
than O. C. Carpenter, for many years one of the best known constables
in Rapids township. Carpenter still insists that he saved the day,
although the ordeal he had to pass through was somewhat harsh. The lye
burned his legs and spoiled a suit of clothes, and he got a good
thrashing at home, in the bargain. The Greek boy of old fell on his
sword, but the modern Linn county boy fell into a soap barrel and by
that side-stepping cast honors on himself and on members of his family
for all time to come.

Bill Harper never uttered the words of which he was accused, and never
knew that Lincoln had been assassinated until the evening of the day
when the infuriated mob was hunting him with a rope, wishing to put an
end to his earthly existence. This shows how dangerous it is to stir up
the mob spirit at any time. It always leads to disgraceful acts, from
which a community suffers for a long time afterwards.


HERE'S AN INTERESTING BIT OF ANCIENT HISTORY

In running through the files of the early years of the Cedar Rapids
Daily _Republican_, the following interesting historical contribution,
from the pen of the late Sampson C. Bever, was found:

     "Editor Cedar Rapids _Republican_:

     "I notice in the last 'Daily Republican,' in referring to the
     City National Bank of this city, in connection with the death
     of the Hon. Oakes Ames, the following:

     "'The death of Mr. Ames recalls to mind the successful aid
     given S. C. Bever, Esq., in getting the charter of the City
     National Bank. The First National had already been
     established and as Cedar Rapids had a population of only
     2,000 people at the time the comptroller of currency declined
     to establish another bank here, but by the assistance of Mr.
     Ames the charter was finally obtained.'

     "The facts in the case are these: The City National Bank
     received its certificate of authority and had commenced
     successful business some time before the application for
     charter or certificate of the First National Bank was
     granted.

     "It is true an application for a City National Bank, with a
     capital of $50,000, was first made, and it was provided by
     the law of congress, creating National banks, that no
     charter for less than $100,000 should be granted, unless it
     should receive the approval of the Secretary of the
     Treasury. Mr. Ames being in Washington at the time this
     application was made, and being a warm friend of mine, he
     kindly offered to give me his influence, and wrote a strong
     letter to Mr. Chase, then Secretary of the Treasury, urging
     him to sanction my application for $50,000, but before
     presenting this letter I was urged by Mr. McCullough, then
     comptroller of the currency, that as there was no other
     national bank organized in Cedar Rapids, and the population
     was about 4,000, I should by all means make my application
     for $100,000, to which I finally agreed. And as greenbacks
     and government bonds were at my command, I had no further
     need for 'successful aid' from anyone, being well known to
     Mr. McCullough, the comptroller of the currency. But I none
     the less highly appreciated the kindness tendered me by my
     friend Mr. Ames.

     "I make this explanation, not so much on my own account, as
     that of others, who so well understand all the
     circumstances.

                                               "S. C. BEVER."

The _Republican_ of that date, May 12, 1873, also printed the following
remarks:

     "The statement that was made in the columns of the
     _Republican_ on Saturday, concerning Oakes Ames and the City
     National Bank, is one of those unfortunate kind of errors
     that often creep into a daily newspaper. The statement, as
     it appeared in print, was precisely as it was handed us by
     one of our prominent citizens, and we took it for granted,
     of course, that it was correct. Since Mr. Bever's
     communication has been handed us, we have made a personal
     examination into the matter, and have discovered an
     important fact which, it is due the City National Bank,
     should be published. We find in the report of the
     comptroller of the currency, that the City National Bank
     stands upon record as number 483, and the First National
     Bank as 500, which goes to show that the former was
     organized some time before the latter. Of course neither
     bank has any interest in this matter further than to be
     placed before the public correctly, and we have it to regret
     that the statement appeared in our columns on Saturday in
     the form in which it did."




CHAPTER XXXVII

_Beginnings of Churches and the Fraternities in Cedar Rapids_


The following accurate account of the beginnings of the churches and
the fraternities in the city of Cedar Rapids, written by the late James
L. Enos in the early '60s, will have a double interest. It not only
gives the story of the beginnings of the various institutions, but also
comments upon their condition and prospects at the time the article was
written.

Methodist Episcopal--This society was organized in 1844, by Rev. Isaac
Searles with nine members. As early as 1841 meetings were held by a
Rev. Hodges, but no society was organized. In 1845 the Rev. Alexander
Bushnell organized the first Methodist Sabbath school. Hodges, Searles
and Bushnell were the first three Methodist ministers who preached in
Cedar Rapids. Rev. Elias Skinner [still living at Waterloo] was the
first pastor who permanently or wholly occupied his time with the
church. During his appointment here the church was in a prosperous
condition. Since that time, from a variety of causes, the interest of
the church has fallen off and its former popularity seems to have
departed. The present number of members is 90; number attending the
Sabbath schools on both sides of the river, about 130. Rev. Mr. Miller
is the present pastor. The church edifice was erected in 1854.

First Presbyterian--This society was organized July 9, 1847, with seven
members, of whom Mrs. Mary Ely is the only surviving member. Bennet
Rogers preached here and at Marion on alternate Sabbaths for a time.
Rev. Williston Jones was the first regular pastor. He continued his
labors with this society until July, 1856, when he removed to Iowa
Falls. Rev. L. F. Dudley was the second pastor and J. W. Atherton
followed in 1859. James Knox is the present pastor. I have not been
able to learn the present number of members attending the Sabbath
school. The church edifice was erected in 1850 and was the first of the
kind in the city.

United Presbyterian (Seceders)--This church is located on the west side
of the river; it was organized in 1851 with eight members. Rev. J. B.
Forsythe was the first pastor, Rev. H. Sturgeon the second, and Rev. J.
L. Fulton the third and present pastor. The church now numbers fifty
members and is in a flourishing condition. Sixty pupils attend the
Sabbath school. The church edifice is a plain brick, erected in 1859.

Second Presbyterian (Old School)--This society was organized May 27,
1855, with twenty members. Rev. R. H. Morrow, a most exemplary and
worthy man, was the pastor. By his admirable qualities he won the
regard of all with whom he came in contact. D. H. Mitchell was the
second pastor. Following the expiration of his labors the pulpit was
temporarily occupied by I. N. Reed, a thoroughly Old School divine. J.
B. McBridge came next, and S. W. Miller is present pastor. The church
now numbers some sixty members, and the Sabbath school has 80 to 120
enrolled. The church edifice is a neat but unpretending structure on
the east side of Adams street, between Market and Sugar streets. It has
a bell weighing 800 pounds and is furnished with a cottage organ. The
pastor's salary is $1,000 a year, and the church is free from debt.

Catholic--This church commenced holding meetings in Cedar Rapids in
1853. Rev. Fr. Hannah officiated here at monthly intervals until 1857,
in which year the church was formally organized. Mass was celebrated by
Rev. Fr. Emmons this same year in the home of Alexander Hager. When
first services were held, 1853, there were but three adherents to the
faith in town. The church edifice, 24x50 feet, located at the south
corner of Jackson and Market streets, was erected in 1857-8. Rev.
Emmons served three years and was succeeded by Rev. Fr. Gillespie, and
he by Rev. Uhlenbrock. The fifth and present priest of this parish is
Rev. Fr. Cannon. The congregation now has about 300 members, most of
whom live in the surrounding country. Last year (1863) a mission was
conducted by Rev. Father Weniger.

Episcopal--The organization of this church took place in 1851, with but
ten members. James Keeler was the first rector, then followed Revs. C.
C. Townsend, Samuel Goodale, Samuel Starr, William Fulton and C. S.
Percival, the present pastor. The corner stone of this church was laid
by Bishop Kemper in 1851, and was consecrated in 1856. It now has about
80 members and the Sabbath school over 100 attendants. The church
building is situated on the south side of Linn street, between Madison
and Monroe streets. The exterior is not yet completed according to
original designs.

Baptist--The present church was organized by Rev. W. Eberhart, the
first settled pastor, June 3, 1860, with a membership of twenty-eight.
He continued in charge until November, 1861, resigning to take
chaplaincy in the Twelfth Iowa Infantry Volunteers. Rev. N. F. Ravlin
followed and remained with the church until April of this year (1864).
The society is at present without a pastor. The congregation now
numbers nearly 140 and the Sabbath school has about 100 attendants. The
society has no church edifice but has purchased a lot on Eagle street
and will build soon.

In addition to these there are scattering members of other religious
denominations, among which are Universalists, Christians, Lutherans,
New Jerusalem adherents, Spiritualists, and perhaps some others are
represented. None of the church edifices are of the first class. In
fact each society is too feeble to erect a church creditable to the
city. We might hope for a more perfect Christian union and with that
would come the ability to sustain a sufficient number of churches,
without the necessity of appealing for foreign aid to enable them to
drag along an existence of doubtful value.


ESTABLISHMENT OF LODGES

Masonic--The Masonic lodge was instituted in November, 1850, by a
warrant of dispensation from Grand Master McCord, and its charter was
issued June 4, 1851, being the twenty-fifth lodge of that fraternity
organized in Iowa. George Greene was the first Worshipful Master; John
Vardy, Senior Warden; Isaac Cook, Junior Warden; Thomas Downing,
Treasurer; N. B. Brown, Secretary; Stephen L. Pollock, Senior Deacon;
J. H. Kelsey, Junior Deacon, and Samuel Hook, Tyler. Seymour D.
Carpenter was the first person made a Mason in this lodge. The
following have been Masters to this date: James Keeler, Thomas Downing,
John Vardy, Hiram Deem, S. L. Pollock, Jacob H. Camburn, and James L.
Enos. James C. Adams is the present Master. The lodge numbers about 75
members and has the reputation of being one of the best working bodies
of Masonry in the state. It was first organized as Cedar Rapids lodge,
but has changed its name, being now known as Crescent lodge No. 25.

Odd Fellows--A lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows was
instituted December 28, 1850, about a month after the Masonic lodge was
organized. It was known as Hope lodge No. 30. It continued its
existence until some time during 1860, when it became defunct. The
original charter members were George Greene, John F. Ely, Absalom
Sines, Joseph Greene and John H. Kelsey. Those who have been honored
with election to office of Noble Grand in this lodge are: George
Greene, Absalom Sines, John P. Ely, W. W. Smith, Joseph Greene, F. A.
Wilmans, L. H. Keyes, Homer Bishop, D. M. McIntosh, Hiram Deem, Charles
Weare, Samuel Milligan, George Livensbarger and C. Fordyce. At one time
the lodge was in a flourishing condition, but through some unfortunate
circumstances it declined, and finally surrendered its charter.

Various minor orders (Good Templars, Sons of Temperance, etc.) have had
a temporary existence in the city from time to time, but none of these
now have a local being.


LATER SKETCH OF THE CEDAR RAPIDS CHURCHES

The following extracts are from an address on Church Day delivered by
Rev. C. W. Maggart, D. D., during the semi-centennial celebration in
Cedar Rapids, June, 1906:

Without doubt the first church organization was the St. Paul's
Methodist Episcopal. The Rev. John Hodges preached here as early as
1840, but it was not until 1841 that the "class" was organized with
twelve people, one of whom, Mrs. John Listebarger, is yet living and
with us today.

This church was organized in the log cabin of Mr. and Mrs. J.
Listebarger on the west side of the river near the west end of the B
avenue bridge. Service was later continued in the first building in
town, in which lived Thomas Sharp. At the time of the incorporation of
Cedar Rapids this church had 148 members and their own little brick
church, built in 1854, and located where the union station now stands.
This church has had thirty-six pastors. Its present church was built in
1873 and is valued at $30,000.00. The number of members is 669.

The second church organized was the First Presbyterian, on July 12,
1847, with nine members, with the Rev. Williston Jones as the first
regular pastor.

The first church building to be erected in the town was the "Little
Muddy" church, which was on the postoffice site, 26x40 feet, and cost
$1,200.00. It was dedicated January 12, 1851.

Fifty years ago this church had sixty-seven members. Prior to the
organization of this church a union Sunday school was held in the first
frame building in the town, in the cabinet shop of John Vardy. This
church has had five pastors, was built in 1869, and has property valued
at $70,000. It has 477 members.

The Grace Episcopal church was the third church organized in the town.
The organization took place in the school house in the summer of 1850.
The first rector was the Rev. James Keeler. These services were later
held in Tisdale's carriage factory. The upper floor was sometimes used
for grain storage, and as it would drop through the cracks it would
attract the attention of the porkers, which would frequently disturb
the meetings with responses not found in the litany. At other times the
upper story was inhabited and frequently the service would be carried
on to the music of the nurse and cradle above. A great interest was
taken in this church when Mr. S. C. Bever and family arrived from the
east with a 750-pound bell. But a still greater interest was manifested
when Judge Greene presented the church with a melodeon. In 1856 this
church had thirty-six members. Today it has 505 members, has property
valued at $100,000.00, and has been served by thirteen rectors.

The fourth church organized was the United Presbyterian, on April 19,
1851, with eleven members; and the first pastor was the Rev. Hugh
Sturgeon. This is the oldest church now in existence on the west side
of the river. Fifty years ago they had about fifty members. Today they
have 225 members, property valued at $20,000.00 and have been served by
six pastors.

The fifth church was the Second Presbyterian, now Westminster, which
was known as the old school Presbyterian church and was organized May
27, 1855, with twenty members. Its first minister was the Rev. R. H.
Morrow. Their first building was located on the east side of Adams
street, between Market and Sugar, and the principal thing mentioned by
former church historians was that they had a bell weighing 800 pounds
and their music was led by a cottage organ. Fifty years ago they
reported fifty members. They report today 500 members, with a property
valued at $60,000.00, and have been served by twelve pastors. Their
present church was built in 1905.

It seems that the First U. B. church was organized in 1855 in the Dairy
Dale district, which was probably then in the country. Rev. McWilliams
was the pastor. They had thirty-five members at the time the city was
incorporated. This church, however, later, went down for some years and
was afterwards reorganized. They have today 260 members, church
property valued at $25,000.00 and have been served by fifteen pastors.
Their present church was erected in 1879.

The Baptist and Congregational denominations had organizations on the
west side prior to 1856 but both were too weak to live.

During the first decade of the city's history two more churches were
started, viz., the Roman Catholic and First Baptist. Fathers Hanna and
Emmons of Iowa City held services for some time before organization and
they only had three adherents. This shows pluck and faith and devotion
to their own church. The church was organized in 1857 and Father
Gillespie was the first regular pastor. This church has had five
pastors. Their present church was built in 1870 and is valued at
$40,000.00. They report 1,500 members.

The First Baptist church was organized in Franklin hall, above
Kilborn's gallery, on June 3, 1860, with twenty-seven members. Rev. A.
G. Eberhart was the first pastor. They purchased a lot on Eagle street,
where their first church was built. Their present church was built in
1894 and is valued at $50,000.00. They have had fifteen pastors and
have now 365 members.

The next decade four or five organizations came into existence. The
first Lutheran services were held in the winter of 1855-56 and an
organization was formally effected in the First Presbyterian church, on
March 3, 1856, with about twenty-two members, under Rev. H. F. Ealy,
minister, who walked from Iowa City to preach to the scattered
Lutherans. Services were irregularly held by Revs. H. F. Ealy, Solomon
Ritz, of Tipton, and J. G. Schaffer, of Lisbon, until 1868, when the
organization was re-formed in the home of J. A. Hart, 211 Fifth avenue,
with thirty members under the Rev. Cephas Baird as regular pastor.

The first church was built on the lot now occupied by the Cedar Rapids
Savings bank, Third avenue and Third street, but this congregation
refused to permanently locate there on such an expensive lot, which was
then worth $300.00. This church has now 368 members and has been served
by eight pastors. The present church was erected in 1881 and is valued
at $20,000.00. A new church costing $35,000.00 is now in course of
erection on the corner of Third avenue and Tenth street. It will be
occupied early in 1911.

The Universalist society was organized in 1869 and the first pastor was
the Rev. W. C. Brooks. For nearly seven years their services were held
in a hall. Their present church was built in 1875 and has been served
by eight pastors. They have approximately 100 members and property
valued at $16,000.00.

The Bethel African Methodist Episcopal church was organized in 1870,
and the first pastor was the Rev. J. W. Lewis. They have had sixteen
pastors and have now seventy-nine members. Their church was built in
1874 and is valued at $5,000.00.

In 1874 St. Wenceslaus church was organized and its first pastor was
the Rev. Francis Chmelar. They began with a church family of sixty.
They have now 1,200 members, a church property erected in 1904 valued
at $50,000.00, and have been served by five pastors.

On July 1, 1874, the Second United Presbyterian church was organized
with the Rev. W. J. McCallister as minister. It continued in existence
for about twenty-four years and its property is being used today by
Sunshine Mission.

The First Christian church was organized August 1, 1875, with
thirty-four charter members. Its first pastor was the Rev. N. A.
McConnell. Since the organization there have been eight pastors. The
present church was built in 1882 and its value is placed at $15,000.00,
although the original cost was $22,000.00. They have a membership of
350.

The Second United Brethren church was organized in January, 1876, under
the Rev. Father Bookwalter, and did good work for a number of years,
but has ceased to exist.

The German Evangelical church was organized April 30, 1877, and its
first pastor was the Rev. C. C. Pfund. They have had twelve pastors and
have now sixty members. Their church was built in 1888 and they have
property valued at $12,000.00.

The Free Methodist church was organized in 1877 and they have had

forty-seven members.

The First Congregational church was organized on May 13, 1879, and its

property valuation is placed at $35,000.00.

The Zion Evangelical church came into being February, 1880, through the
work of Rev. Ilion. The Rev. J. E. Stauffacher was the first regular
pastor. They have had nine pastors and have now 175 members. Their
church was built in 1905 and is valued at $23,000.00.

The German Lutheran church was organized August 24, 1884, with twenty
charter members. Revs. Studt from Luzerne and Aron from Atkins, Iowa,
preached for nearly one year on alternate Sundays when the Rev. J.
Denckmann, its present pastor, became the first regular pastor. They
have a membership of 350 and a church property valued at $10,000.00.

The Swedish Lutheran church was organized November 8, 1885, and its

the value of their property is $50,000.00. They report at present 1,000
members.

In the decade 1886-1896 the first church organization was that of
Trinity Methodist Episcopal in 1887, with the Rev. Frank P. Shaffer as
first pastor. The present church was built in 1890, and the value of
all property held by this society is estimated at $20,000.00. They have
450 members and have been served by seven pastors.

Sinclair Memorial Presbyterian church was a growth out of a Sunday
school fostered by Mr. T. M. Sinclair. Its organization was effected
October 14, 1887, and its first pastor was the Rev. Alfred K. Bates.
They have had four pastors and now enroll 215 members. Their present
church was built in 1902, the gift of Mrs. T. M. Sinclair, and is
valued at $30,000.00.

The Bohemian Presbyterian church was organized in 1889. Its first and
only pastor was and is the Rev. V. Hlavaty. They have now 257 members.
Their church was built in 1889 and is valued at $5,000.00.

The Calvary Baptist church was organized on September 5, 1890, and its

had six pastors. Their present church is valued at $3,000.00.

The Central Park Presbyterian church was organized May 4, 1893. Its
first pastor was the Rev. R. A. Van der Las. They have now 205 members
and have had three ministers. Their present church was built in 1904
and is valued at $20,000.00.

The Danish Lutheran church was organized in 1893. They have forty-eight
members, have had six pastors and have property valued at $4,000.00.

The Danish Baptist church was organized April 1, 1895, and its first
pastor was the Rev. A. Charlsen. They have had six pastors and have now
17 members. Their church was built in 1899 and is valued at $700.00.

The first church organized in the last decade was the Second Christian
church which grew out of a Bible school organized in 1901 and has a
membership of 125 and has been served by three pastors. They have
property valued at $5,000.00.

The Olivet Presbyterian church came into existence on May 15, 1904. Its

members, a church property erected in 1904, and valued at $8,000.00.

The Dunker church has been in existence for several years, but was not
formerly organized until 1905 under the present pastor, Dr. S. B.
Miller. They have been served by five pastors, have a church property
valued at $4,000.00 and have thirty members.

The Reformed church came into formal existence March 29, 1906. The
pastor is the Rev. Frank S. Bromer. Services were held for about a year
before this organization by the Rev. Rohrbach. They have now
twenty-nine members and are building a new church. The present value of
their property is estimated to be $2,900.00. At the completion of this
new church their property will be worth $6,300.00.

Fifty years ago this town had about 1,500 people. Of these 386 were
members of the six churches, one in four. Today, with a population of
30,000, the thirty-three churches report 10,286 members. With five and
one-half times as many churches and five times as many ministers we
have twenty-seven times as many members.

The city has twenty times its former population, and the churches have
twenty-seven times their former membership.

The total value of the church property today, exclusive of schools and
outside property, is above $750,000.

All of this goes to show that the churches are very much alive and are
among the most progressive institutions in the city.

Two hundred and forty ministers have served these churches since the
beginning of their history.

CHAPTER XXXVIII

_Catholicism in Linn County_

BY REV. P. J. FLYNN


All honor to those pioneer clerics and laity for the work they
accomplished under trying and difficult circumstances. In the pioneer
days no musical sound of silvery bell, from lofty steeple or tall
minaret called them on the Sabbath morn, no swelling peal of organ or
trained choir entertained or invited the worshipers in those early
days, there were no Godly ministers to bury the old and instruct the
young, no books, or papers to read and to gather wisdom from their
pages, to strengthen the weak and enlighten the dull. No need to be
scandalized if in some instances, we find men grow weak under such
trying circumstances. No wonder that pioneer conditions among miners
and others, were such as to indicate little fear of God or little
regard for men. Little do we know, in this age of ease and facility, of
the difficulties and dangers, offered in those days to priest and
people.

The effort of the writer of the following pages will be to chronicle
facts, well established and authentic, relative to the church in Linn
county, rather than to draw on imagination or to give color to his
assertions from a rhetorical viewpoint. It is the scope of history to
chronicle events relating to the past, for present and future use.
There is no assertion made in these pages that has not been
investigated and truthfully established, in most cases by those who
were eye and ear witnesses to the events referred to.

In order to understand how difficult it is to obtain correct
information about the early days in a new country it is both
educational and interesting to engage in such research. One would not
imagine that information concerning things and conditions of less than
fifty years ago would be so difficult to obtain. Yet the fact remains,
and this fact is in itself a strong argument in favor of works like the
present.

It is hardly credible that the early settlers could accomplish what
they did under circumstances as they were in those days. What strength
of character and determination of purpose these early settlers showed
in the face of difficulty and danger is truly admirable. What noble
ideals they had, and how earnestly and well they strove for their
attainment. The present prosperity is due in no small degree to their
untiring efforts in laying the foundation of present advantages.
Posterity may well hold their names in benediction, and the heart may
with pride and reverence swell with admiration for the hardy pioneer
whose heritage is now enjoyed. The present moral standards of the
people, the numerous schools and churches and the general intelligence
have been builded on the foundations laid by our ancestors and are
monuments and tributes to their character, influence and enthusiasm.
When Linn county was but a mission district from Iowa City, meetings
were held whenever and wherever the priest found it convenient for the
best results or for the convenience of the greatest number of souls.
Sometimes service was held in a log cabin, sometimes in a district
school house. When the missionary contemplated a visit his intention
was announced through the district; the date and place of meeting were
made known and thither the scattered settlers gathered on foot or on
horseback or in wagons. They were happy in their inconvenience at being
allowed even in such circumstances to make their peace with God and
receive the consolations of religion.

Such were the conditions in Linn county half a century since. How
little we realize the advantages we enjoy in this day.

Few and far between, however, were the visits of the shepherd to the
scattered hamlets of the early settlers. Missionary men went about,
preaching and teaching and their lives were an example to all with whom
they came in contact. Of such men and their life work, we have now to
treat.

The first record we have of the interests of Linn county in things
Catholic was in 1853, when Father Emmons of Iowa City with apostolic
spirit and Christlike zeal journeyed through the trackless wastes to
cater to the needs of the children of the faith.

In those days, fifty-seven years ago, it is needless to say Cedar
Rapids was not known as the Parlor City. Its pretensions were very
modest. It consisted of only a few small residences with a few stores
to supply the needs of the people.


THE CHURCH IN CEDAR RAPIDS

The chief business industries in those days were the lumber mills of
Mr. J. J. Snouffer, Sr. The wild and trackless wastes were being
gradually cleared, and the logs were being fitted for the formation of
rough log cabins to shelter man and beast. Rough fords or bridges were
thrown across the irregular and meandering streams which flowed in
undisturbed tranquillity on their way towards the Father of Waters. It
was nothing unusual frequently to find that the temporary bridges were
carried away over night and the log dweller found himself in the
morning isolated and compelled patiently to wait the subsiding of the
waters to furnish himself with the necessaries of life.

In these days the missionary priest passed along giving his blessing to
the work as he went, and in log cabins or improvised chapels fed the
bread of life to the hungering sheep of the fold.

The first record there is, and that in the memory of those who were
present, of mass being offered in Cedar Rapids was in 1853, when Father
Emmons of Iowa City, celebrated the holy sacrifice for the first time
in the old Dubuque House in B avenue between Fourth and Fifth streets.
It is a regrettable fact that the location has since been turned to
uses less holy. During his visits afterwards from his home town to
Cedar Rapids he always stayed, and officiated at the Snouffer home on
Second street, which in those days occupied the site on which now
stands the Denecke store.

In those days the Catholic settlers came for miles around to Cedar
Rapids, and assisted at divine service whenever the goodly priest found
it possible to come among them. In wagons drawn by oxen they wended
their way from the western part of the county, from Fairfax, and along
to the Benton county border line, and even beyond. Often their journey
meant days of delay owing to impassable ways and washed out bridges.
All honor to those pioneer Catholics who so prized their religion and
their faith. No wonder that seed sown under such trying circumstances
brought forth fruit which abides. Among the early settlers who gave
such proof of their worth and dared difficulties for their religious
opinions we find the names of Murray, Keenan, Cook, Hayden, Lilly,
Kehoe, Meehan, Flaherty, Cahill, Langan, Christopher, Villeen,
Harrington, Hager, and others.

Another pioneer of those days was Father Smith who occasionally visited
the itinerary of Father Emmons when the latter was unable to do so. Fr.
Harmon, also of Iowa City, came a few times into this territory and
assisted in sowing the seed and nurturing it in its tender years.

After Fr. Harmon's departure the duty again rested upon the shoulders
of Father Emmons until Father Gillespie was sent by Bishop Smith to
form a new parish in Cedar Rapids, along in the early sixties.

The first effort that was made to establish a church in Cedar Rapids
was when a piece of property was secured on Sixth avenue and Sixth
street, near the present residence of Dr. Skinner. Those who were
leaders in this laudable undertaking were J. J. Snouffer, Sr.,
Alexander Hager, and Francis Lilly. Objection was made to the selection
of the site on Sixth avenue and Sixth street from more sources than one
and attention was next directed towards the present site on Third
avenue and Seventh street. Through the efforts of the above mentioned
men three lots were secured, and operations were begun and a little
church constructed large enough for the needs of the time. The lumber
was obtained at Snouffer's mill, the workmanship was contracted for by
Alex. Hager, who was a carpenter, and the means were supplied by Mr.
Lilly, Mr. Thos. Murray, Andrew Stark, John Meehan, Flaherty, and
others. After Father Gillespie came Father Enlinbrook, who retained the
charge only a short time. After his departure Fr. Shields came
occasionally in missionary work.

In 1865 Fr. Cannon assumed charge and remained about two years.

In the fall of 1867 Father P. V. McLoughlin came and remained about six
months.

One would naturally expect that by this time the congregation should
have grown considerably, but the fact is that on the first Sunday of
October, 1866, rosary Sunday, the congregation consisted of between 20
and 30 souls and they were from the surrounding country as much as from
Cedar Rapids.

In 1870 Fr. Lowry (who was a convert to Catholicity) took charge of
Cedar Rapids and from that date we have a continued resident priest and
a regular history. Soon after his arrival he set to work to build a
church more in keeping with the needs of the place, since at this time
many settlers had come from Illinois and things began to look more
encouraging for our religion.

Though his resources were limited, yet he had confidence that while the
purses of the people were light, their hearts and their hands were
generous. Nothing daunted, he put his hand to the plow and the result
was the front part of the present Immaculate Conception church. The
foundation in rock work was the gift of Mrs. J. J. Snouffer, Sr., who
was ever willing and generous to aid both the priest and the people,
though she was not of the household of the faith. I venture to predict
that her generosity and true Christian charity is on record in the
"Liber Scriptus" and that it will not go unrewarded by the Just Judge.

To aid in the completion of this great work Fr. Lowry engaged both men
and women, old and young. Among those who contributed materially in
money and cooperation in every way we find the names of Mrs. J. J.
Snouffer, Sr., Mrs. F. Lilly, Mrs. James Cook, the O'Hara family,
Hayden, Hager, Kehoe, Harrington, O'Keefe, Foley, Cook, Mullally,
Keenan, Murray, Meehan, Langan, Cahill, Flaherty, McVann, Brecht, Peter
Flynn, Killen, Thos. Murray. By the generous and combined efforts of
these and many others the desired end was attained and God's house was
a reality in Cedar Rapids.

Having secured the church the next ambition of the good and zealous
Father Lowry was to secure a parish school, wherein the foundation
would be laid and the seeds sown in future church members and pillars.
The first and only parish school up to this time was a modest and
unpretentious institution in which a young lady named Caroline Hager
taught the children of the parish, who numbered about fifteen.

In 1874 under the direction of Father Lowry the following men were
chief among those who built the school: James McNamara, John O'Hara,
Charles O'Hara, Peter Flynn, Mr. Springer, Alexander Brecht, John and
Charles Murray, the Cannons, Mullally, O'Briens, McVann, McDonalds.

The first Catholic cemetery was the present Bohemian Catholic cemetery
purchased by John O'Hara, Peter Flynn, John Foley, John O'Keefe, and
James Barrett. The first Catholic buried in this cemetery was Mr.
Flaherty, father of Pat. Flaherty of the west side. The second funeral
held there was that of Mrs. Martin Sheehan, about the year 1865.

In 1878 or thereabouts Fr. Lowry secured through Mr. Mullally the
ground for the present cemetery at Kenwood for a consideration of about
$100.00. Then the old cemetery became the exclusive property of the
Bohemian Catholics of Cedar Rapids. This transfer was effected through
Father Francis Chemlar for a consideration of $900.00. Of this amount
$300.00 were contributed by E. R. and W. H. O'Hara. In 1880 Fr. Lowry
was transferred to Burlington and was succeeded by Father T. F. Gunn,
of blessed memory. At this time many settlers had located around Cedar
Rapids and it began to be an important town. Soon the church had to be
enlarged. In order to do so, the old parochial residence which was to
the rear of the church edifice had to be removed and a new residence
constructed. When this was accomplished, an addition was built to the
church, giving it its present shape and dimensions. In the construction
of this addition and all the incidental work that such changes entail
as well as in the erection of a parochial house Father Gunn found
plenty to do during his declining years in Cedar Rapids. He was not a
man given to material building, as much as to the upbuilding of
spiritual conditions in the hearts of his people. He was active and
energetic even to his dying day. He was in sympathy with his charge and
lived in the heart of his congregation, not above them. He was a
thorough christian gentleman, and a man of honor. He believed in
"being" and not "appearing," in doing and not in saying. He was the
servant of his people, not their lord. He was a faithful follower of
Him who forgot Himself in His care for others. No man ever held a
warmer place in the hearts of the people of Cedar Rapids than Father
Gunn. Even today his name is in benediction and his praises sung by
non-Catholic and Catholic alike.

The Rev. Thos. F. Gunn was born at Strokestown, Roscommon county,
Ireland, December 3, 1840. He studied the classics in Ireland and
philosophy and theology at St. Francis Seminary, Milwaukee. He was
ordained priest at Cape Girardeau, Mo., in 1867. His first appointment
was to Cedar Falls, Iowa. At the time there was only one priest west of
him, at Fort Dodge. While stationed at Cedar Falls Father Gunn had
under his charge thirteen stations in Blackhawk, Grundy, Butler, and
Bremer counties. During these times a seventy-mile drive in a
springless wagon was a common experience.

In 1870 Father Gunn was transferred to Sioux City. His charge was St.
Mary's parish which then consisted of a modest frame structure on West
Seventh street, across Perry creek. At that time the priest's house
consisted of a one room structure. Father Gunn after a short time in
Sioux City was transferred to Dubuque Cathedral, where he remained
three and one-half years and went thence to Burlington, where he
remained till 1880, when he came to Cedar Rapids to succeed Father
Lowry.

At his advent to Cedar Rapids the condition was much different from
what it today presents. It was but an outpost of the onward march of
civilization and no one dreamt that the coming years would bring about
so great a transformation as is today in evidence. Father Gunn was
twenty-six years in Cedar Rapids at the time of his death. Shortly
before his death he delivered his last public address at the opening of
the semi-centennial celebration held on June 10, 1906, in which he
forcibly manifested his liberal views and referred to the
transformation which had taken place within his memory in the city.

Father Gunn died on June 24, 1906, and his funeral was one of the
largest and most representative ever held in Cedar Rapids. His eulogy
was delivered by Dr. J. J. Fitzpatrick, of Marshalltown, and the
speaker paid a becoming and merited tribute to the beloved and popular
clergyman. His remains lie buried in Kenwood cemetery and the citizens
of Cedar Rapids have erected a suitable monument to perpetuate his
memory and hold his name in benediction.

After the death of Father Gunn, Father Toomey became pastor of
Immaculate Conception church, which position he still occupies. Great
hopes are held out by the people of Cedar Rapids congregation for the
welfare of the church interests. A new and commodious church is talked
of and the hope entertained it will some day materialize. However as it
is not becoming to praise the soldier while he is in the firing line,
and as "Praise after death" has been my motto I must leave to the pen
of the future historian to chronicle the deeds and sing the praises of
the present pastor of Immaculate Conception church.


ST. WENCESLAUS PARISH

St. Wenceslaus Bohemian Catholic parish of Cedar Rapids was established
in 1874. Those through whose prayer and cooperation this new and
independent field of activity was called into existence were chiefly
the following: Thomas Brouzek, Vaclav Charipar, Natej Charipar, Thos.
Chadima, J. Hajek, Fr. Horek, Joseph Kofron, Jos. Pivouka, Vit Kuba,
Fr. Kofron, Hynek Krejic, V. Lessinger, Jos. Pivouka, V. Hrebec, H.
Sindelar, Jan Stolba, V. Stolba, Jos. Sefranek, Jan Tomanek, Votja
Zaruba, Ignace Sindelar, Mathew Kofron, Frank Biskop, Jan Vanous, Marie
Tuba, and some others from the surrounding country districts.

A lot was purchased, and in August, 1874, the foundation of the first
Bohemian Catholic church in Cedar Rapids was begun. It was an eventful
day for the Bohemian element in the city. In 1875 money was borrowed
and collections made by parishioners, and all resources were drawn on
to obtain the necessary means of perfecting the work already begun. In
1878 the balance of the debt was paid by the united effort of a poor
but earnest people. In fact the donors, considering their
circumstances, were generous.

In those days of difficulty and want the parish was in charge of Father
Chemlar, who with all the zeal and earnestness of an apostle attended
to the varied duties and needs of the scattered and needy congregation.
From his limited salary of $200.00 he gave to the more needy and often
donated his time and talent without any consideration whatever. God be
with those days of disinterested and apostolic labors.

The old St. Wenceslaus church was a rock building 75x27 feet. It was
without a tower. The bell was erected on an improvised structure in
front of the church and its silvery tones seemed to more effectively
accomplish its mission and reach the hearts of the people, than our
costly and superior ones of today as they ring out from their costly
towers or tall minarets.

To house the good father of the flock, a modest parochial residence was
built by the people and in the basement of the unpretentious home,
parish meetings were held and school was taught for years. It was in
the days of the good Father Chemlar also that the first Catholic
cemetery was secured by the people of St. Wenceslaus parish.

In 1889 Father Francis Chemlar was promoted to the charge at Norway,
and he was succeeded at St. Wenceslaus by Father John Broz. Fr. Broz
remained about two years in Cedar Rapids and during his short stay was
by no means inactive. He added to the seating capacity of the church
building and also built a tower in the church.

The next pastor was Father Kopecky. To his zealous and persistent labor
is due the parish school which still remains, in which the youth of the
parish receive the rudiments of knowledge in things secular and
religious from the good Sisters of Mercy.

At this time the pastor's income was only $650.00, yet from this
comparatively modest sum the good father found a modest means of doing
material good for others and himself. He was a great school man and
often spent hours in the school room, keeping at the class work. He
was popular with the people and accomplished much good.

Following Father Kopecky came Fr. Vrba who remained only a short time
and was transferred to Protovin.

In 1900 the present incumbent, Rev. Florian Svrdlik, was installed
pastor of St. Wenceslaus. Soon after his advent a new church was spoken
of and being a man of action as much as of word, he began to feel the
pulse of the parish on the matter. Seeing the interest and earnest
manner in which the new pastor took hold the people flocked to his aid
and in a short time the work assumed practical shape. Ft. Svrdlik is
not a man who builds a church on paper years before he has his brick
and mortar on the ground. He builds first and then talks of a reality
and not of a dream. With the unanimous aid of the people, he organized
a fair, and from this realized about $4,000.00.

Through the other ordinary means of collections and donations this
amount was increased in a short time to the extent of $10,000.00. To
this fund his grace, Archbishop Keane, of Dubuque, contributed $500.00.

At Christmas, 1903, the necessary property was secured, and on August
4, 1904, the corner stone was laid, and on October 18, 1905, the new
church was dedicated with solemn and impressive ceremony. The occasion
was one long to be remembered by the people of St. Wenceslaus and Cedar
Rapids in general. The new church is beautiful in design and faultless
in execution. It was erected at a cost of about $40,000.00, a lasting
monument to the zeal and efficiency of the pastor and to the piety and
generosity of the Bohemians of Cedar Rapids.

The parochial school erected in Father Kopecky's time is his
imperishable monument. It is in charge of the Sisters of Mercy. It is a
beautiful building, plain and substantial in its style, spacious and
well ventilated and well calculated to develop a sound mind in a
healthy body. There are about 175 pupils at present attending the
school and sowing the seed which will enable them to develop into
sturdy men and women.


ST. PATRICK'S, CEDAR RAPIDS

St. Patrick's parish on the west side, Cedar Rapids, was organized
April 18, 1886. Its first resident pastor was Rev. T. F. Richardson,
who was transferred from Fairfax. The first parish church was a modest
frame structure on Second avenue and Seventh street west. While its
seating capacity was limited yet it gave ample accommodation for the
few parishioners, whose interests had heretofore been attended to, from
the parent church on the east side, and occasionally from Fairfax.
Father Richardson retained the charge till the time of his death, which
occurred on September 12, 1888. After his demise the interests of the
young and struggling parish were entrusted to Rev. M. J. Quirk, who was
succeeded by the present incumbent, Rev. T. J. Sullivan who was
appointed November 17, 1889.

At this time many were locating on the west side who retired from the
country around to spend the evening of life in a well earned rest after
enduring for years the trials and difficulties of pioneer conditions.
Soon the little frame church became inadequate to the needs of the
place, and Father Sullivan, with that solicitude which has ever marked
his life and labor, began to entertain the wish of a more suitable
building. It did not take long for his efforts to be supported by the
hand and heart of his people, and on October 18, 1891, the corner stone
of the present beautiful building was laid. The late Very Rev. Father
Gunn officiated and the sermon on the occasion was delivered by the
Rev. C. M. Carroll, D. D.

The new church at First avenue and Fifth street, west was dedicated on
August 28, 1892, by Bishop Hennessy, of Dubuque.

St. Patrick's church is one of the most sightly buildings in the city
and when the frescoing which is now being done is completed it will be
one of the neatest houses of worship in the city.

The building when completed cost about $15,000.00. Father Sullivan took
charge of the parish about November 17, 1889. The congregation is now
large and representative.

Having secured a beautiful church Father Sullivan's next undertaking
was the building of a school in keeping with the needs of the parish.
The corner stone of this beautiful and spacious building was laid on
May 10, 1902, by Dean Gunn.

The school is in charge of the Sisters of Charity of the B. V. M.,
whose mother house is at Mount Carmel, Dubuque. The Sisters of Charity
as educators hold a similar place in the religious congregation of
women to that occupied by the Jesuits among the male orders. They are
the leaders in their respective classes. And the pupils turned out by
both orders today are an honor to their alma mater.

There are several sodalities and societies attached to St. Patrick's
church and the parish is growing rapidly.


THE CHURCH AT PRAIRIEBURG

It has been asserted that the first mass celebrated in Linn county was
at Prairieburg. This assertion I have sought to establish, but have
failed, so I take it for what it is worth. As far as I can learn the
first mass was said in a log house belonging to James Brislawn, but who
the priest was I have not been able to establish. The first authentic
record we have is when Rev. P. J. Maher, late of De Witt, then at
Anamosa, officiated in the home of Bernard McLaughlin in 1872. The
present brick church on the prairie at which a goodly number worship
and which is in charge of Rev. Fr. I. J. Norris of Stone City, was
erected by Fr. Maher in 1874. The Bohemian element who live in and
around Prairieburg built a church a few years ago in the town. It is in
charge of Father Ballou of Oxford Junction.


THE FAIRFAX CHURCH

The first Catholic church in Fairfax was built by Fr. John in 1875.
This cradle of christianity in the wilds was located on the state road
in Johnson county about six miles southeast of Fairfax. For the
construction of this primeval temple oak logs were hauled from the
Henderson mills on the Iowa river below Robert's Ferry. From this same
mill, which was the only one at that time in these parts, except the
Snouffer mills in Cedar Rapids, the early settlers hauled the lumber
for their log cabins and for the shelter sheds for their limited live
stock. This pioneer church in Fairfax district was afterwards removed
to Walford, later to the site of the present building.

After Fr. John came Fr. Urbin occasionally from Norway. He returned to
Bohemia and died there.

Among the early settlers were John Flaherty, who came in 1855; John B.
Murray in 1858, Wm. McNamara, Andrew Stark, whose children now enjoy
the fruits of his labors; the McDonalds, O'Connells, Donohues, Winekes,
Wickies, Brechts, Springer, Barretts, O'Hara, P. Flynn, Foleys, Cook,
Haydens, Hager, Cahill, Langan, Killeen, Kehoe, Meehan, Harrington,
Lilly, Murray, Cannon, O'Brien.

Before this time however there were some scattered settlers in and
around the site of the present town. Among the early settlers were
Thos. Murray, father of J. E. Murray and Charles Murray of this city,
John B. Murray who came from Illinois in '56 or '58, and located in
Benton county. John Flaherty, father of P. Flaherty, who came from
Illinois in '55 by way of Iowa City. In those days there were very few
settlers and the country around was densely wooded where the wild deer
and wolf held undisputed sway. The nearest and only Catholic church was
in Iowa City and there the pioneers journeyed periodically to make
their peace with God. There were no roads, and travelers were compelled
to follow the beaten path through thicket and forest. In these
journeyings danger and difficulty were ever present. The hardships
endured for the sake of religion remind one of the experiences of Saul
of Tarsus. Whenever Father Emmons came from Iowa City to Cedar Rapids,
his intention was declared some days before and a herald brought the
glad news to the settlers who came in from their desert haunts and
swelled the congregation at Cedar Rapids. These were literally the days
when these faithful pioneers, poor in the world's goods but rich in
faith, hungered and thirsted after justice.

When the church was built at Cedar Rapids the faithful at Fairfax were
looked after for some years till their number increased. Fr. Urbin, who
was stationed at Norway, later on also aided in keeping the lamp of
faith burning brightly. This was along about 1868. Later on Fr. John
Chemlar took care of their interests till in 1875 Father O'Farrell came
to abide with the faithful of Fairfax and was their first resident
priest.

The field of operation in Fairfax was too limited for the zeal of
Father O'Farrell and he remained only a short time. He was succeeded by
Father McCaffrey who was energetic in his labors, but because limited
in his resources was not able to accomplish much, and time hung heavily
on his hands. He left soon after. After this time, however, things
began to look more encouraging and we find some such sturdy men as John
Flaherty, Thomas Murray, John Murray, Pat Harrington, Wm. Harrington,
Maurice Cahill, Andrew Garrett, John Sears, Henry Wickie, putting their
shoulders to the wheel and from their limited resources, giving
material aid in the upbuilding of conditions. The next resident priest
was Father Quinn who came from the east. He was a man of action. He set
to work and organized the parish in practical shape and doubtless had
he been spared Fairfax would be today one of the leading parishes in
Linn county. He died after two years from pneumonia contracted while
attending to his flock.

After the death of Father Quinn, charge of affairs was assumed by
Father Kelly, who was succeeded by Father Richardson, who enlarged the
church edifice, which still remains a monument of early days and
pioneer conditions, but hardly in keeping with these days of opulence
and ease. After about four years pastorate in Fairfax, during which
time he attended Cedar Rapids west side people, he was transferred to
the west side of Cedar Rapids and built the first church in that place.

This church was located at Second avenue and Fifth street west, and was
a frame structure 60x32 feet. It was at this time, April 18, 1886, that
St. Patrick's parish was first organized and Father Richardson was its
first pastor and he retained the charge until his death in September,
1888. Father John Brogan assumed the charge of Fairfax parish in April,
1886, and remained seven years, during which time he labored earnestly
for the good of religion and was much beloved by the people. During his
pastorate he built a beautiful, well equipped modern residence, which
still remains and is occupied by the present incumbent. After Father
Brogan's removal Father John Hogan assumed the charge of the Fairfax
parish and during his stay of five years he labored zealously to pay
off the indebtedness on the church property and has improved things
generally. He afterwards exchanged Fairfax for his present charge Van
Horne, and Father Thomas Reynolds of Van Horne came to Fairfax where he
remained till his death. He was succeeded by the present pastor, Rev.
P. Reynolds, who has done much to better conditions and who hopes one
day to build a church in keeping with the present enviable status of
this wealthy community.

THE CHURCH AT WALKER

For many years, the faithful of this town and the surrounding districts
were attended from Independence. In 1887 Very Rev. Fr. O'Dowd, of
Independence, erected a church at Walker, and for four years attended
to the same from his home in Independence. In 1891 a new parish was
established by Bishop Hennessy, and Rev. James Ryan, now of Calmar,
Ia., was appointed first resident pastor. Having a church already
secured the new pastor directed his zeal towards the erection of the
present parochial residence. While the parish was not numerically
extensive, yet what it lacked in numbers was supplied in interest and
zeal, and the new pastor in his apostolic spirit and unflagging zeal
soon had the good will of his congregation entirely at his disposal and
with their generous cooperation in hand and heart and as far as
circumstances permitted in currency, he erected a fine home for the use
of the priest and had it paid for in a short time. During his stay of
three years in the parish he also improved and completed the conditions
in church and church property which required attention. Fr. Ryan is the
best type of a truly apostolic priest, the zeal of God's house and the
happiness of God's people, being the single purpose which at all times
animates and actuates his life and action.

After three years, Archbishop Hennessy, recognizing his earnestness and
efficiency, assigned him to a new and more varied field of operation
and he was succeeded at Walker by Rev. John McNamara, now of Key West,
Dubuque. Fr. McNamara's stay in Walker was of only short duration,
about three months, when in obedience to the wish of authority he went
to Key West. After his departure the present pastor, Rev. Wm. Leen,
assumed jurisdiction and his stay in Walker for sixteen years is the
explanation of the present flourishing condition of the parish. Vast
improvements have been effected, in the church and church property, and
today Walker takes its place not only among the Catholic churches in
Linn county but among the churches in any county in the state.

The pastor is a most zealous and priestly man, an erudite scholar and a
profound and persistent student. He is not selfish, and generously
gives of the fruits of his research through the columns of pamphlet and
press. Fr. Leen also occasionally lets his thoughts run along metrical
lines.

Besides Walker, Fr. Leen also extends his zeal and paternal care to
Rowley and another mission station which is not in Linn county. But
while frequently engaged in historical research, and contributing to
current literature, he finds abundant time and opportunity to feed the
sheep and the lambs over which he is shepherd and does his duty so well
that he is most popular not only with his charge but with the community
in general.


THE MARION CHURCH

One of the prettiest churches in Linn county today is St. Joseph's at
Marion. It was built by the present pastor, Father P. M. Loughvane.
Like most other places in Linn county the early settlers in Marion had
to endure hardships for their religion. The settlers were few and far
between and the only consolation they had from a religious standpoint
was the occasional visit of a missionary priest from some outside
charge.

In the years 1855 and 1856 a good priest named Father Smith came
occasionally from Iowa City to minister to their needs and preach them
a word of encouragement. In those days Father Emmons also came from
Iowa City and contributed to keep the lamp of faith burning. Father
Laurent, of Muscatine, also came to Marion occasionally and did
missionary work among the pioneers.

As a rule the faithful journeyed to Iowa City whenever the weather
permitted. In these days there were no automobiles nor telephone
service, and it was not at all uncommon for the travelers to be
weather bound on their way to or from the scene of their religious
observance. Sometimes they had to sleep all night in the wagon in the
midst of the woods when the swollen streams prevented their going any
farther. It looks like something one may read about, but there are
those living today who recall it as a fact. Waiting till the river
flowed by, or at least till its current became less rapid, or till the
hidden ford appeared--such were the trials of pioneer days in Linn
county, and such the tests the faithful were subjected to.

After 1870, Marion was attended by Father Lowry, of Cedar Rapids. After
Father Lowry's time the faithful of Marion were attended by Father
Richardson, of Fairfax, and after his transfer to St. Patrick's he
continued to minister to their needs. His successor, Father McQuirk,
continued to assist in bringing the consolations of religion to the
early settlers. In later days Father John Brogan, of Fairfax,
ministered to their needs whenever time and opportunity permitted.

Father Timothy Sullivan, after his appointment to St. Patrick's, also
ministered to their needs and to this day has many friends who are
mindful of his kindness in the days of want.

The first resident priest in Marion was Father Laffin, who came in
1890. At this time and indeed previous to this the chief settlers in
the Marion district were the Senekir family, the Reillys, the Davises,
Colburts, Zimmermans, and Zackeries, and these were the first who took
hold and established the first church.

The church, by reason of the fewness of its members, was a difficult
problem to maintain. It was supported chiefly by the active and
energetic assistance of the people in holding sociables and picnics and
such other ways and means as were worthy of the noble cause.

When the building was completed there was an indebtedness of $1,800,
and nothing to pay this amount from. The sale of the property was
threatened by those who held the lien on the church. But the zealous
and hard-working members of the congregation set to work, and in two
years this amount was paid off.

After Father Laffin's departure the charge was taken by Rev. J.
Hartigan, now at Strawberry Point. For eight years this zealous and
interested young priest labored early and late for the welfare and
comfort of his flock. During his time the present parochial residence
was erected at a cost of $3,000. It is a modest, unpretentious
building, but fitted up with all the modern systems of hygienic and
healthful appliances. Not content with being comfortably housed
himself, Father Hartigan decided to secure also a becoming habitation
for his Lord and Master. He decided that a new church was now a matter
of necessity in Marion, and gradually he got the members of the
congregation to his way of thinking. He held fairs and sociables to
obtain the necessary funds to make his dream a reality, and at his
transfer from Marion he left in the church treasury more than $2,000 as
a nucleus for the new church building. The completion of the work was,
however, reserved for his no less interested and zealous successor.

Writing of the conditions in Marion at his appointment, Fr. Hartigan
says:

     "I got my appointment to the charge in the winter of 1896,
     about December 1st, and I shall never forget my feelings on
     arriving there. I found the parish in excellent condition to
     try a man's grit and patience. There were about thirty-five
     families, more or less actively engaged in parish work.
     There was a debt of upwards of $3,000, with no home except a
     log cabin, and an old church that had stood the test of the
     winters' blast for well nigh forty years. I heard murmurs on
     all sides, some thinking that all their property would be
     lost. I had many expressions of sympathy. I told the people
     in very few words that I was not looking for sympathy
     (although I needed it), that I was sent there to work, that
     works, not words, were of more avail in those circumstances.
     I tried to arouse their fainting spirits and told them to go
     and put their shoulder to the wheel, which they did with a
     willingness and energy that was beyond my most ardent
     aspirations. In about two years we had the parish clear of
     debt. Then it was necessary to build a home to supplant the
     poor log cabin, one of the old landmarks that did its work
     for well nigh half a century. To show the dilapidated
     condition of that abode I may say that I was frequently
     compelled to move my bed around to escape the rainfall. But
     thanks to the generosity of the people and their willingness
     to work and to give, the home was built in almost as short a
     time as it would take to tell it. It was a gigantic
     undertaking at the time, but where there is a will there is
     a way, and the home was built and paid for in about one year
     after the church property debt was liquidated. That home
     cost about $3,000, and every cent was paid before it was
     occupied. Then the cement sidewalks were laid at a cost of
     about $120, and last but not least came the greatest
     struggle of all. The parish had progressed so far so well,
     and it was my desire and the people's desire that their work
     should be crowned with success. The crowning work of all was
     the building of that magnificent little church that now
     stands on the corner of Tenth street. It was not my
     privilege to see it built before I left the parish, but for
     that purpose the people and myself labored tooth and nail in
     season and out of season, so that when I got my appointment
     to Strawberry Point in October, 1904, I turned over to the
     present pastor upwards of $2,000. I may say before I close
     that the spiritual advancement of the people more than kept
     pace with the material development of the parish."

Rev. P. M. Loughnane, the present pastor of St. Joseph's, was born in
County Kerry, Ireland. He received his classical education at St.
Brendan's Seminary, Killarney, and studied philosophy and theology at
St. Patrick's College, Thurles, where he was ordained to the priesthood
on June 18, 1803. Coming to Dubuque, he was assigned as assistant to
Very Rev. E. McLoughlin, at St. Mary's, Clinton, Iowa. He was
afterwards transferred to take charge of the parish at Sabula. Thence
he went to State Center, in Marshall county, where he remained eight
years. While at State Center he interested himself much in school work
which he loved. Fr. Loughnane is a versatile scholar, a man of bright
mind, and keen sense of discernment. His ability as a priest he has
demonstrated by the beautiful new church which will ever remain a
monument to his competency and the earnestness and worth of his people.
Bearing in mind that the congregation at Marion is not numerically
large nor gifted with the possession of any too much of this world's
goods, the sacrifices they made for the new church are much enhanced.
The greater number of the members of the charge are railroad employees
and more or less of a fluctuating class. But the Catholic heart is cold
and callous, indeed, that cannot grow eloquent with faith when
contemplating the visible, the material evidence of a great personal
sacrifice for the faith.

Soon after his advent to St. Joseph's parish the pastor applied all his
energy to collect for the new church, and by earnest and energetic
effort raised about $5,000, each and every member of the congregation
doing his or her duty in a manner truly admirable.


THE CHURCH AT LISBON

One of the oldest, if not the mother church in Linn county, is that at
Lisbon. We have evidence of its existence and of early settlers for
whose use it was erected dating as far back as 1854. Records show that
Fr. Emmons, of Iowa City, the father of Catholicity in Linn county,
made frequent visits to the little town, and baptized and ministered to
the needs of the early settlers. Even farther back than 1854 it is on
record that this pioneer of the faith offered the holy sacrifice and
administered the holy sacraments in the home of Thomas McAllister, east
of the town of Lisbon.

There are those living today who remember these times and conditions,
and the fact is not questioned that some of the present members of the
Lisbon congregation were regenerated by the saving waters of baptism in
the home of Thomas McAllister, and it is even possible to meet
occasionally those who well remember Father Emmons and his teaching.

It was through the efforts of this faithful pioneer shepherd, aided by
the good will and support of the scattered few, that the old church of
Lisbon was called into existence, and it is through veneration for the
pastor and the pioneer that it is still allowed to stand, though no
longer used for divine worship. This old landmark was erected in 1854.
The site on which the little edifice was erected was donated by Jacob
S. Pfautz, who also contributed to the present church building. Be it
said to their eternal honor that among the contributors for the first
church there are several names which are not belonging to the limited
list of Catholics of those days.

Among the pioneers of those days we find such names as Peter Heller,
George Ringer, Mike Hoover, Samuel Bell, Fred Rabenau, William Andre,
Thomas McClelland, I. G. Trigenfuse, Sam Ellison, John Walton, J. A.
McClelland, Joseph Owens, Thomas Andre, and others.

Father Emmons was only a missionary in Lisbon at the time his home
charge was Iowa City, but as far as preaching and teaching the word and
breaking the bread of life to the children of the faith his
jurisdiction was not confined by any boundary or limitation.

The first resident pastor of Lisbon was Rev. W. Downey, who resided
there for about three years after his term of service. Father Daly
followed, and for a short time resided in Lisbon, and afterwards in
Mechanicsville, and is spending the evening of his life in Atlantic,
Iowa. After this time Lisbon was attached to Marion and was attended
for a while by Father Laffin. When Father Hartigan succeeded to the
charge at Marion he also attended Lisbon.

It was reserved, however, to the present popular pastor of Marion, Rev.
P. M. Loughnane, to add another laurel to his crown by replacing the
old time-honored landmark with the present ornate and well designed
church building.

The Catholic cemetery, which is a part of the property of this charge,
was purchased in Father Downey's time.


THE SISTERS OF MERCY

The Sisters of Mercy came to Cedar Rapids on the Feast of St. Mary
Magdalen, 22d July, 1875. They came from Davenport, which at that time
was subject to Dubuque Bishop for there was only one diocese in Iowa.
Sister Mary Isadore and Sister Mary Gertrude were the first to visit
Cedar Rapids, and in a few weeks afterwards Sister Mary Agatha and
Sister Mary Francis came. These four formally took possession of the
building which had been secured for school purposes, and in September,
1875, St. Joseph's Academy and parish school was opened for the first
time in Cedar Rapids.

This community at Cedar Rapids remained subject to the mother house in
Davenport until 1881, when the southern part of the state was cut off
and made a new diocese. This new division of the Dubuque diocese
necessitated the subjection of the Cedar Rapids community to the
diocese of Dubuque and so the branch house became an independent
community in November, 1881.

At this time the community at Cedar Rapids consisted of about ten
Sisters, and there were about twenty-five boarders at St. Joseph's
Academy at the time.

Previous to the installation of Father Quinn as pastor of Immaculate
Conception church the parish school was independent of the academy.
After this they were united and the academic school became a free
school for all those who were unable to pay for tuition.

[Illustration: QUAKER OATS TRAIN]

[Illustration: SCENE ON CEDAR RIVER]

[Illustration: ST. PATRICK'S CHURCH, CEDAR RAPIDS]

This arrangement continued till the spring of 1905, when the Sisters
secured the beautiful house and property known as Mound Farm, on which
they now have a beautiful mother house and academy. Up to 1905 St.
Joseph's was the mother house of the Cedar Rapids community. Now the
mother house is at "the Mound."

The new Sacred Heart Academy opened in September, 1905, with thirty
boarders. It is situated on the same location as the mother house of
the community.

From the Cedar Rapids mother house of the Sisters of Mercy the
following branch houses have been and are supplied: Decorah, Grand
Junction, Anamosa, Manchester, De Witt, Charles City, Elma, Oelwein,
Bernard, New Haven, Waterloo, Marion, St. Wenceslaus, St. Joseph's,
Cedar Rapids, with Mercy Hospital, and a new hospital at Kalispel,
Montana.

In the community at present there are about one hundred and thirty
members. In the novitiate or preparatory school for aspirants to the
Sisterhood there are about forty young ladies laying the foundation for
their future life work.

Any attempt at church history in a state or in a city would be
incomplete without honorable mention of the Sisters. The history of the
parish school is also the history of the Sisters, that glorious body of
women who have given and who give their lives to the uplifting of the
human race. That branch of the Sisterhood which devotes their lives to
teaching is one of the most powerful allies the church has in keeping
her members faithful. The teaching orders are not alone in the work of
education. The Sisters have done a great work on the battle field and
in hospitals in opening the eyes of the world to the great ends sought
by the church.


MERCY HOSPITAL

There are many orders, each doing their own work in their own place.
Wherever there is work to be done, or good deeds to be performed, there
we find the Sisters with an eye single to their work and looking for
their reward in the world to come. To come from general to particulars,
I would be untrue to my promise if I did not call particular attention
to one institution in particular, namely, Mercy Hospital. There are few
Catholics in Iowa who are not acquainted with Mercy Hospital, Cedar
Rapids, and the great work being done by the Sisters of Mercy.

The absolute need for such an institution became so much a necessity in
Cedar Rapids that on November 15, 1900, the Sisters for the first time
began operations in an old residence quite near their convent. For
three years, under conditions entirely inadequate, they ministered to
the needs of their constantly increasing patrons, till they were
compelled by necessity and their rapidly increasing work to build the
present institution, which compares favorably with any similar
institution in the country and offers every facility to the medical
profession.

The corner stone of this beautiful building was laid on August 15,
1902, and the building was completed by December 1, 1903. It cost over
$100,000. It is in charge of the Sisters of Mercy of Cedar Rapids
community, who also have charge of Sacred Heart Academy on Mound Farm,
and of St. Joseph's parochial school, with St. Wenceslaus' school and
St. Berchman's Seminary, Marion, together with several schools through
Iowa, and of the Mercy Hospital at Kalispel, Montana.

So great has been the success of this institution that there is need at
present for an addition. There is a large training school for nurses in
which at present there are twenty-five pupils. The management of the
institution is accomplished by the Sisters, who at present number about
fifteen, among whom there are seven qualified trained nurses.

Ability of more than ordinary character is required to manage
successfully an institution like Mercy Hospital. And as the work
increases the greater the strain on the management. This position of
trust and responsibility has been capably filled for nearly ten years
by Sister Mary Alphonsus. She it was who first assumed charge of the
little hospital on Third avenue. She has seen that mustard seed grow
into the present beautiful institution. Sister Alphonsus, always
solicitous for the comfort of others, overtaxed her limited strength.
Never physically strong, she has given herself most generously in
constant care and vigilance to the duties of her responsible position.
Forgetting herself to be of help to others, it is not surprising that
her frail constitution should give way, when one considers the
responsibility of her position. This fact, coupled with the recent
death of her beloved mother, to whom she was much attached, almost
completely undermined her physical condition, and acting on the advice
of her medical adviser and that of her superior mother, N. Teresa,
Sister Alphonsus retired from the hospital to recuperate her failing
strength. During her years of office she made herself a general
favorite with all with whom she had to do.


SACRED HEART ACADEMY

This high grade school fills a long felt want in Cedar Rapids and Linn
county. There is no more suitable location for a young ladies' academy
than Cedar Rapids, and for its site there is not perhaps in the west a
place more suited than where the Sacred Heart Academy stands. Situated
on the highest elevation, perhaps, in the county, it is by nature and
the skill and taste admirably fitted to generate both sound minds and
healthy bodies. Recently a new addition has been built to the former
academy.

The church realizes that true progress is the law which God has given
to His creation. Any progress is creation continued. The gospel of
Christ is the gospel of progress. The mind to be progressive must seek
Him and find Him, and finding Him, be of value to the child and the
state.

This the church understands better than she gets credit for, and this
is the reason why her parish school is her first care after her own
existence has been established. Hence any attempt at her history which
would not include her schools would be incomplete and dwarfed. In the
school is sown the seed which is afterwards nursed and cared for by the
church, in its life-giving sacramental system.

One of the chief parish schools in Linn county is Sacred Heart Academy,
at Green Mound Farm. It is a school for young ladies in which are
taught all subjects which qualify candidates for the varied positions
to which they may wish to aspire, such as teaching, bookkeeping,
stenography, etc., etc.

St. Berchman's Seminary at Marion is a boarding school for boys who
have not attained the age of fourteen. In this school, which is in
charge of the Sisters of Mercy of Cedar Rapids, the most approved
methods are employed in imparting thorough and comprehensive
instruction in all the elementary branches of an English education,
together with a marked attention to the moral culture of the boys,
which makes them an honor to their parents and society. Careful
attention is given to their physical needs and bodily comfort, and
diligent care is extended in seeing that their time in the seminary is
put to the best advantage. Music and elocution are among the subjects
taught.

The seminary is located on First avenue and Fifteenth street. It is
situated on a twenty acre area, beautifully wooded, and affording
excellent facilities for outdoor games which boys usually indulge in.

The seminary has its own sources of supply in all edible stuffs. It has
a beautiful orchard and vegetable gardens, and its needs in the way of
dairy produce and poultry are supplied from its own farm. While within
the city limits, it is far removed from noise and all disturbing
elements which may in any way militate against the best results.

The apartments are spacious and are furnished with every modern
improvement conducive to health and comfort. The building is heated by
steam, well ventilated, and lighted by electricity. Hot and cold water
are in use for the bath system. At the present time a large addition is
being built to meet the needs of the increasing patronage.




CHAPTER XXXIX

_Linn County Statistics_


POPULATION

In 1840 the greatest number of people to the square mile was in the
extreme southeastern part of the territory. This was but natural, as
nearly all the settlers had come by river from St. Louis, only a few
coming by wagons up to this time. The settlers had in part come up
along the Red Cedar river, and Linn county claimed a population of
1,373, few of whom had lived more than two years in the county.
Settlers also ascended the Iowa and Des Moines rivers. By 1850 land
seekers had followed the Des Moines river and had already found homes
as far west as Boone county.

It was a severe blow to the agricultural interests of Linn county and
the newborn state when news of the gold fever reached the borders. Not
only the newspapers stirred up the people, but hundreds of parties
crossed the state in wagons, stopped along the way and talked
incessantly about the great diggings in California. The young men were
fired with enthusiasm. Work on the farm was hard and the returns small.
Thus Linn county lost many of its best and most enterprising young men.
Some, it is true, returned again after a stay of a few years in the
gold fields, but a large number never came back, but either died or
remained on the coast. While Linn county lost many settlers it also
gained others, who started west expecting to join mining parties, but
who settled down as farmers instead. From 1849 to 1857 was a restless
era of migration in what we call the middle west. In fact it extended
over the entire country. There were many causes for this. An era of
prosperity sprang up after the Mexican war, the gold discoveries and
the opening up of much fertile land by the government. All this, no
doubt, stirred people to find new homes or seek new adventures. The
panic of '57 of course for a time put a stop to all speculations,
especially in western lands.

The greatest influx of people into the state was from 1850 to 1856,
when the population increased from 192,214 to 517,875, an increase of
169.4 per cent. The population of the state for 1910 is 2,225,771. Linn
county felt the same influx, for the population increased from 5,444 in
1850 to 14,702 in 1856.

There seems to have been an increase of about 8,000 by the census of
1860, showing that while the panic may have kept some at home who might
have gone west, few new settlers sought the west to make new homes. The
population of the county and the towns will give the reader an idea of
the gradual growth in the population.

Here are some figures showing our development:

In May, 1838, the population of the county was 205. This had increased
to 2,643 in 1844. In 1847 we had 3,954 people, 4,762 in 1849, 5,444 in
1850, 6,870 in 1852, 10,802 in 1856, 18,947 in 1860, 18,693 in 1863,
showing the effects of the Civil war, this conflict not only taking
many of our substantial citizens to serve in the armies, but for the
time impeding emigration.

In 1865 the figures had increased to 20,754, in 1867 to 24,549, in 1870
to 31,080, in 1875 to 31,875, in 1880 to 37,237, in 1885 to 40,720, in
1890 to 45,303, in 1895 to 49,905, in 1900 to 55,392, and in 1905 to
57,362.

[Illustration: MERCY HOSPITAL, CEDAR RAPIDS]

At the time this is being written the population for the county for
1910 has not been announced.

The cities and the towns of the county have grown with it.

Cedar Rapids in 1885 had 15,426 people; in 1890, 18,020; in 1895,
21,555; in 1900, 25,656; in 1905, 28,759; and in 1910, 32,870.

Marion in 1885 had a population of 2,673; in 1890, 3,094; in 1895,
3,766; in 1900, 4,102; in 1905, 4,112.

Mt. Vernon boasted of 859 people in 1885, 1,259 in 1890, 1,178 in 1895,
1,629 in 1900, and 1,664 in 1905.

Lisbon's population in 1885 was 703. No statistics are available for
1890, but in 1895 the town had 817 people, 956 in 1900, and 948 in
1905.

The population of Center Point in 1885 was 565; in 1890, 615; in 1895,
595; in 1900, 674; and in 1905, 823.

Springville in 1885 was credited with 561; in 1890, 518; in 1895, 562;
in 1900, 509; and in 1905, 582.

In 1890 the population of Central City was given as 467; in 1895, 594;
in 1900, 623; and in 1905, 607.

Walker in 1895 had 485 people, 505 in 1900, and 571 in 1905.

In this connection it is of interest to note that in 1836 the
population of Wisconsin Territory, of which Iowa was then a part, west
of the Mississippi river was, Dubuque county 4,274, Des Moines county
6,257, or a total of 10,531.

A second census was taken in 1838, which showed that there were in
sixteen counties organized from the original two counties a population
of 22,859. Jones county had 241 people at this time, Cedar 557, Johnson
237, and Linn 205.

In the first constitutional convention, which met at Iowa City October
7, 1844, and adjourned November 1, 1844, this county was represented by
Thomas J. McKean, Samuel W. Durham, L. M. Strong.

The constitution adopted by this convention was rejected by the people
at an election held August 4, 1845, the vote being, for 7,235, against
7,656.

In the second constitutional convention, which met at Iowa City May 4,
1846, and adjourned May 19, the county was represented by Socrates H.
Tryon.

At the election on August 3, 1846, this constitution was adopted by the
people by a small majority. It was presented to congress in December,
1846, and on the 28th of the same month an act was passed for the
admission of Iowa into the Union.

The third constitutional convention sat in Iowa City from January 19 to
March 3, 1857, and adopted a constitution which was ratified by the
people on August 3 following. In this convention Linn's representative
was Hosea W. Gray.

In this county the vote on the constitution was 1,307 yes, 955 no. In
the state the vote was, yes 40,000, no 38,681. The result shows the
first sign of a change in the political sentiment in state and county.
The republicans favored the constitution, and the democrats opposed it.

Following are the members of the General Assembly from Linn county from
1846 to date. In the Territorial Legislature, 1843-4, Robert Smythe was

CHAPTER XL

_The Bridges Across the Cedar at Cedar Rapids and Early Steamboating on
the Cedar River_


One of the most enterprising men who devoted all his time to the
upbuilding of Kingston, which later became part of Cedar Rapids, was
David W. King, who arrived a short time after Robert Ellis. Mr. King
and the settlers on the west side of the river early devised schemes by
which to get in touch with the east side and the county seat. True, it
was all right when the river was frozen over and in summer when the
river was down so that it was safe to ford the stream, but there were
times when it was impossible to ford the river on account of high
water.

D. W. King obtained a license to operate a ferry across the river,
which he continued to run up to the time of his death in 1854. This
ferry was operated till about 1857 when the bridges were opened. Even
for some time after the first bridge was put in operation did the ferry
do much business, as the first bridge soon after it had been completed
went out with the flood in the spring of '57, and the second bridge,
finished that fall, also went out by an ice gorge in January the next
year. Then for a time the ferry was used from and to May's Island as
the bridge from the east side to May's Island had been properly erected
so as to stand the floods.

The establishment of a ferry at this point brought trade to Cedar
Rapids and accomplished much in making Cedar Rapids a business center,
to which place travelers and others came. It was not till many years
later that free bridges could be offered to the citizens of the town.
But in this respect the city was ahead of other cities of the state.

It was David W. King who early began a toll bridge, and it is said that
"when the boulder in the river near the Watrous mill was visible the
early pioneer could with safety drive across the river." If it was not
they had to pay for crossing on the toll bridge. David King's ferry was
the first step in the direction of progress in Cedar Rapids. By virtue
of a law which went into effect December 22, 1848, Mr. King was
authorized to establish and keep a ferry across Cedar river at a point
in Linn county opposite Cedar Rapids for a term of ten years with
exclusive privilege for the space of one mile on either side. Here King
for a number of years did a thriving business, and Cedar Rapids
received the benefits of the trade which extended west into Benton
county.


THE FIRST BRIDGE

In an old paper, being part of the records of the house passed January
23, 1853, the following may be found: "An Act to create a Board of
Commissioners with authority to erect a free bridge across the Cedar
River at Cedar Rapids in Linn County.

     "SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the
     State of Iowa that John M. May, Frederick A. Williams and
     Gabriel Carpenter be and are hereby appointed and
     constituted a Board of Commissioners to receive voluntary
     subscriptions in trust for the erection of a free bridge
     across the Cedar river at Cedar Rapids in Rapids Township,
     Linn County, with a draw of not less than forty feet in
     said bridge for the free passage of boats and other craft
     navigating said river.

     "SEC. 2. Provided, that the Board should furnish Bonds in
     the sum of $20,000.00 to be approved by the County Judge of
     Linn County.

     "Sec. 4. Providing, that the construction of the bridge
     should be begun within ninety days from the time of the
     beginning to collect subscriptions and that the bridge
     should be completed within two years from the time that
     active work was begun."

This bridge was begun in the fall of 1856 and completed during the
winter of 1856 and 1857. It was located below May's Island at the foot
of Daniels street, now Seventh avenue. This bridge was really gotten up
to spring a real estate boom in property owned by Carpenter, Major May
and others on the west side of the river. It is said Major May himself
subscribed $1,000. However, the location of the bridge was ideal. It
was needed and was something the people of the town took a great pride
in; in the early day toll bridges were the rule and not the exception.
During the early spring of 1857 this bridge in a high flood was carried
away and two sisters by the name of Black, living on the west side and
who were crossing the bridge at the time, lost their lives.

During the following summer there was much agitation for a bridge,
especially by the people having real estate and residing on the west
side of the river and farmers who had located in the western part of
the county as well as in southeast Benton county. During the summer a
floating bridge was built across the river at what is known now as
First avenue. This was also a short lived bridge, having been carried
away by the ice gorge in the spring of 1858.

During the same summer materials were secured and some was saved from
the old bridge and a temporary bridge was erected across May's Island,
between May's Island and east Cedar Rapids, while on the west side a
ferry boat was used. In February, 1855, the county court granted a
license for twenty-five years to H. G. Angle for the erection and
maintenance of a toll bridge at First avenue. It provided that no other
toll bridge should be erected on the river for two years within two
miles on either side of this contemplated toll bridge. In the decree of
the court it was also mentioned that in case a free bridge was
constructed within two miles a reasonable sum of money should be paid
to the person or company owning the toll bridge. This toll privilege
was transferred in the following year to George Greene, John Weare,
William Greene, P. W. Earle, A. F. Steadman, H. E. Higley, N. B. Brown,
Lowell and Lawson Daniels, E. H. Dobbs, J. J. Child, and J. P. Rogers.
This bridge, however, was not opened for traffic until the winter of
1859-60. The stockholders were made up of Cedar Rapids people, and at
one time the stock was above par. The prices charged were as follows:
25 cents for a double team and wagon; for driving cattle 5 cents a
head: for driving sheep 3 cents a head; and for pedestrians 1 cent
each. Some time later reduction was made by the management for round
trip ticket holders. Many squabbles were had over these tickets. It is
said that an Irishman came to T. J. Dudley, Jr., wanting to start suit
for preventing him returning, he having lost his round trip ticket, and
offering him $10.00. Mr. Dudley quietly went down to the office of the
company and told the man to cross. He was permitted to do so and
willingly parted with his $10.00 to Dudley, the latter paying the
customary price to the gatekeeper. This story of Dudley's wit, showing
how a lawyer got the best of it, was repeated in many families in Cedar
Rapids, and as a consequence a number of young men took up the study of
law for a profession.

For a number of years citizens residing in west Cedar Rapids and in the
eastern part of the county made various attempts for a free bridge
across the river. Much of the grain and produce came from Benton county
and the western part of Linn county. A number of grain merchants and
others were located on that side of the river and had their grain in
storage at that place and were asking the railroad authorities for
permission to erect freight houses on that side of the river. A number
of citizens of Cedar Rapids who were interested in Kingston real estate
also attempted this enterprise, believing that the time was not far
distant before Kingston would become the more important town of the
two. A petition was circulated for a free bridge across the Cedar river
and presented to the board of supervisors to take the matter under
consideration. At the January term, 1871, the board appropriated
$14,000 for the purpose, providing that the city or citizens of Cedar
Rapids, or both, should guarantee to furnish the balance of such sum as
should be necessary to pay for a first-class iron bridge across the
Cedar. It was further provided that no part of the county funds should
be expended until the whole sum necessary had been raised by
subscription or otherwise. The citizens of Cedar Rapids, and others
interested in the city, at once circulated petitions for funds and also
authorized the mayor of Cedar Rapids to call an election and vote on
the question of issuing bonds to aid in the construction of said
bridge. This petition was signed by S. C. Bever, one of the early
bankers, and by more than fifty citizens wanting a bridge located at
what is now First avenue, asking that the city vote bonds to the extent
of $6,000, promising that the citizens would guarantee the balance for
the erection of a bridge.

Another petition was signed by John F. Ely and about one hundred other
citizens all interested in locating the bridge at the foot of Park
avenue, now Third avenue. These gentlemen asked for the issuance of
$12,000 worth of city bonds, and were willing to guarantee any
additional sum necessary over and above the amount appropriated by the
county and city, which they were to raise by private subscription.
Thus, there were two factions within the city, one working against the
other in the matter of the location of the bridge. These factions were
composed, of course, of people who were interested in the location at a
point that would be most advantageous to their private interests.

During the winter of 1870-71 it was very cold and severe until in March
when it became suddenly warm. Heavy rains followed and the river on or
about the first of March was very high and the ice commenced to move
out. Large quantities of ice came rolling and surging down the stream
and carried everything down the river. In a few days the toll bridge at
First avenue went down, struck by one of the ice floes which made it
collapse. The Bourne saw mill also became a total wreck, and more or
less damage was done to all the mills along the river. On account of
the disaster to the toll bridge all communication with Kingston was cut
off and it became necessary to do something at once.

The city council was called together and the mayor called for an
election. In this council sat J. J. Snouffer, Dr. Mansfield, Stephens,
C. C. Cook, David Denlinger, E. S. Hill, James Bell, and E. Robbins,
with Mayor Thomas Z. Cook. The city voted bonds to the extent of
$12,000 by a majority vote of 483 for and 83 against the bond
proposition. All this time E. Robbins, one of the aldermen, operated a
small boat called the "Aurora," which had previously been used between
this point and Vinton, as a ferry boat above the dam. It was so
arranged that eight teams could cross at the same time.

About the same time Keech & Co. established a ferry boat that was
operated by horse power attached to a cable stretched across the river.

[Illustration: JUDGE N. M. HUBBARD]

The two men having the most to do with the building of this bridge were
William Ure, a member of the board of supervisors, from Scotch Grove,
and William Richmond, a part of the city council, who had charge of the
entire work. These men devoted a great deal of their time in helping
along the speedy construction of the bridge. The contract for the
superstructure was let in April to Messrs. O'Hanlan and O'Hara at a
cost of $22,000.00. The contract provided that the work should be done
within ninety days from April 15th. The bridge proper was erected by
the Canton Bridge Company, of Canton, Ohio, and cost about $20,000
for the abutment and piers. The other necessary masonry work made a
total cost of $42,000. The bridge fund consisted of the following
amounts: The county expended $15,000; city bonds, $12,000;
subscriptions paid, about $16,000.

For many years this bridge was considered as a county bridge and all
moneys used for repairs were paid from the county bridge fund; later it
was looked upon as a city bridge, and repairs, etc., were paid for out
of the city treasury. This bridge was completed August 15th and a
celebration was had. It is still used and the bonds have long since
been paid.

During the year 1874 the board of supervisors appropriated $8,000 for
the B avenue bridge and the citizens subscribed $22,000, of which sum
N. B. Brown subscribed $5,000, George Greene $4,000, William Greene
$4,000, Higley estate $2,000. A contract was let for the bridge in
September, 1874, in the amount of $28,500; other additions were made,
making the bridge cost about $32,000.

Fourteenth avenue bridge, known as the James street bridge, was begun
in August, 1875, and completed in December of the same year at a total
cost of $27,000. The county appropriated for this bridge $11,500, the
city $6,000, and the property owners paid $9,500, T. M. Sinclair paying
the largest amount.

The First avenue bridge was constructed in 1884 at a cost of about
$25,000, the bridge being opened for traffic in November, 1884.

The Second avenue bridge, being a cement bridge with railings, cost
about $110,000, and was opened for traffic in December, 1905.

The new Fourteenth avenue, or James street, bridge was commenced by the
Union Construction Company in 1909, and completed in the spring of 1910
at a cost of about $80,000.


EARLY STEAMBOATING ON THE CEDAR

The following account of some early steamboating adventures on the
Cedar river is from the pen of B. L. Wick, and is taken from the first
volume of the _Proceedings_ of the Historical Society of Linn county.
It is of interest.

The subject matter of steamboating on the Cedar will scarcely attract
any attention today and means only a pleasure jaunt with more or less
inconvenience among sandbars on the upper river. However, historically
speaking, steamboating on this river was an epoch-making period for
this section of the country, and the prosperity of our city was due in
a large measure, to our dam, our grist, saw and woolen mills; and to
our steamboat traffic. These industries made Cedar Rapids.

It has been said that the history of a town is frequently the history
of a great river. This is true of nearly all the great European cities
and is equally true of the great marts of commerce in this country. The
great Father of Waters has, however, played an important part in the
development of the middle west, of which great body of water the Red
Cedar is one of its many tributaries. It has been stated that this
great river system has 16,000 miles of navigable waters, and it is
further the river along whose banks at least three of the European
powers have contested for the extension of territory. I shall leave
this discussion out of the question, and confine myself to one of its
many branches--the Red Cedar.

It was not till August 7, 1807, that Robert Fulton propelled the
Clermont up the Hudson by means of steam navigation at the rate of five
miles an hour, and solved forever, the great question of water
navigation. It was not long till the inventor and his friend,
Livingston, extended their operations to the great west, and began
building steamboats at Pittsburg, and on December 6, 1812, the
"Orleans" of 400 tons burden, was the first steamer which made the trip
to New Orleans, and thus opened up the newly acquired possessions. This
boat was commanded by W. I. Roosevelt, a sturdy ancestor of a worthy
descendant.

Prior to this time the products of the great West had been transported
by means of rafts and flat boats, both slow and dangerous. Now river
trade could be carried on up as well as down the river, and in what was
then considered very quick time.

During the year 1819, Capt. Nelson was the first to propel a steamer,
"The Independence," up the Mississippi river from St. Louis. It was not
till 1825, according to an old pioneer, Dr. Isaac Galland, that Capt.
James White, commanding the steamer "Mandan," passed the rapids at
Keokuk.

In 1831, Col. George Davenport, the founder of the town which bears his
name, explored the Red Cedar as far as Rock creek, and at this place
established a trading post with the Indians, which continued for four
years. This is the first navigation of this river by the whites on
record. The first steamboat on the Des Moines river, of which we have
any knowledge, was in 1837, which arrived as far as Keosauqua. The
first keel boat was owned by Capt. Cash, and came up in the following
year.

It seems that the settlers of the territory early began to encourage
steamboat traffic with the world. On the 12th of January, 1839, the
legislature of Iowa Territory empowered a company to incorporate in the
amount of $200,000, in order to build a slack water canal from the
Cedar river to the Mississippi by way of Rock creek. An act was also
passed for the inspection of steamboats, boilers, etc., at this
session. Congress on November 6, 1846, for the purposes of improving
the river traffic, granted certain lands to the Territory of Iowa, to
aid in the improving of the Des Moines river for the purpose of
navigation. Even the other day a large appropriation was granted for
the erection of locks and a canal at the Keokuk rapids on the
Mississippi.

The Red Cedar river is about 248 miles long and is comparatively free
from any rapids as far as this city, and hence, was early looked upon
as one of the most favored rivers for steamboat navigation. The Iowa,
into which the Cedar empties, is about 240 miles in length, and not so
favorable for navigation.

It is well known that Linn county was created by an act of the
legislature of Wisconsin territory, and approved December 21, 1837; and
the spot which our city now covers, was settled the following spring,
by Osgood Shepherd and William Stone, soon followed by Robert Ellis,
Philip Hull, the Listebargers, Thos. Gainer and David King.

[Illustration: VIEWS ALONG THE CEDAR RIVER]

One cannot speak of steamboating without mentioning Robert Ellis, our
respected pioneer who landed on the present confines of our city May 8,
1838, and found only one shanty inhabited, which was on the present
location of the T. M. Sinclair packing house, and was owned by Philip
Hull; the other hut was built near the Cooper mills and was then vacant
as the owner, Osgood Shepherd, had gone east for his family. Mr. Ellis
located on his present farm that summer and obtained a patent for it
from President Polk, and he is no doubt one of the very few in this
county who hold title direct from the government of this date. Mr.
Ellis in the winter of 1846, had three flat boats built at Palo, each
boat being sixty feet long, sixteen feet wide and drawing three feet of
water when loaded. On these boats he loaded four thousand bushels of
wheat which he consigned to Noble and McCutchins, of Burlington,
millers of that place. On each boat he had three men and these were
provided with side oars to be used when they got into bends of the
river. They started with their cargo the latter part of March and
arrived after some trouble at Burlington; when arriving at Burlington
the firm were in financial trouble and it looked as though the men
could not get their pay, but it was finally arranged if Mr. Ellis could
take flour to New Orleans, they could then realize some money and he
would be paid. They remained here for some little time, and started out
the three flat boats again, loaded down with flour. They were a long
time in getting down the stream but kept on paddling when they got fast
in the stumps and otherwise floated down the river. By the latter
part of June they arrived at New Orleans in safety and disposed of
the flour, but again were unable to realize on the flour as it had been
consigned to certain brokers and the payments were tied up. They took
in the slave markets and otherwise looked around the great city which
was now the great emporium of the west and the southwest, and then took
steamer for Burlington. Arriving at Burlington Mr. Ellis stood no show
of getting his money, but trusted to luck and bought a horse, riding
horseback from Burlington to Cedar Rapids. Not till that fall did he
realize anything on this wheat deal, and finally was paid after much
trouble by the parties, who were not dishonest, but whose property
interests had been tied up so they were unable to realize on their
goods sufficiently to pay creditors.

The new waterway of Robert Ellis became the subject of conversation for
some time afterwards, and it inspired others to greater activity. The
people realized that they must have an outlet, for their produce and
cheapen transportation, if possible. It became the subject of serious
consideration by the settlers. If this question could be solved, the
greatness and importance of the city as a commercial center would be
assured. By 1839, keel boats had reached Ivanhoe, and quite a trade was
carried on at certain seasons of the year, mostly in the spring, and
much grain and farm products were taken away in trade for provisions.

Thus Squire Holmes, the Higley Bros., Daniels & Co., and several
others, from Marion and Cedar Rapids, in the early forties built flat
boats at Westport and Ivanhoe and traded groceries and other articles
the farmers needed for wheat, pork, and other produce. This stuff was
shipped in the early spring on flat boats. Sheds were also erected so
as to store the grain until such time as the boats could be loaded. Old
Henry Rogers also erected a saw mill and shipped a little lumber down
the river. It was dangerous and not practical to get the lumber down
stream, and the scheme was abandoned.

The first large Mississippi steamer, which came as far as our city
limits, was in the month of August, 1844, called the "Maid of Iowa,"
when a number of settlers and also a part of Mormons came as
landseekers.

"The first stream boat at Cedar Rapids was the 'Maid of Iowa' commanded
by Capt. Chas. Ross. She landed and cabled to the saw-mill on the 3rd
of August, 1844, just as the sun was setting."--Extract from Account
Book kept by N. B. Brown.

On this boat was Rev. Isaac Searles, born in 1812, who located in
Johnson county in 1842. He gave the first sermon in true Methodist
fashion from the deck of the steamer, and talked to a large concourse
of people who had assembled from the surrounding country. Each
passenger was offered a lot by the enterprising people of the city. As
a result of this steamboat venture, a Methodist church was organized at
the home of one of the Listebargers. During the next ten years, many
large and small Mississippi steamers made the Cedar river points as far
as Cedar Rapids, and quite a trade had been established between St.
Louis, Keokuk, Burlington and this part of the state.

The last of the large Mississippi steamers, which made Cedar Rapids,
was the "Uncle Tobey," of two hundred tons burden, which made her way
up here among the brush and overhanging willows in the spring of 1853,
and remained at the Third avenue landing for several days, at what is
now the Warfield-Pratt-Howell building. When departing, after taking on
a large cargo of grain and produce, she steamed up the river and turned
down the channel on the west side of May's island. A number of people
are still living who remember this steamer and the shouts and waving of
handkerchiefs as the steamer glided smoothly down the river and out of
sight.

From the _Annals of Iowa_, Vol. 5, page 401, I quote the following
showing the rainfall in this state from 1848 to 1855: "In 1848, 26
inches; 1849, 49 inches; 1850, 49 inches; 1851, 74-1/2, inches; 1852,
49 inches; 1853, 45 inches; 1854, 23 inches and in 1855, 28 inches." Up
to 1858, the rainfall was below the average, while during the years
from '58 to '59, it was above the average. From the newspapers of that
time, it seems that there were a great many floods during the summer
months, so that steamboating was common on all the rivers during the
entire year until frost came.

The question has frequently arisen, whether or not the rain fall was
greater fifty years ago than now, and on the whole, from the old
settlers, and from reports, as kept, it would seem to be about the
same. All agree, however, that there was more water in the rivers, and
they give their reasons as follows: "That the channel of the river was
more narrow, and that the rivers were deeper, and free from the mud and
the sand, which have now accumulated due to the tilling of the soil.
Then the river banks were lined with trees, which protected the water
from the rays of the sun, and the sloughs were filled with water all
summer on account of the high grass, and all these sloughs, creeks,
bayous, supplied the river with water during all seasons of the year,
which is now not the case." All the water which fell in those days
found its way into the river, which is not true after the ground became
cultivated to any extent, so that it has been figured out that only
about a fourth of the water finds its way into the river. This, of
course, may be one of the reasons why steamboating was possible fifty
years ago and is not now.

Of the many enterprising settlers, who came west to make this city
their home, there were a number of enterprising, wide-awake and
industrious men, who had courage and besides possessed more than
ordinary ability along commercial lines. Among these settlers, George
Greene, who was a prime mover in every new enterprise, succeeded in
organizing a company for the building of a steamboat, to be called the
"Cedar Rapids," and to be especially built for navigation upon the Red
Cedar river. In this company were, besides Mr. Greene, W. H. Merritt,
the Daniels family, Dr. J. F. Ely, Dr. S. D. Carpenter and later, W. B.
Mack. A contract was entered into with parties at Pittsburg for the
building of a modern steamboat, to be of white oak 155 feet long,
single deck, stern wheel, clinker built, to be arranged for freight and
passenger traffic, and to draw the least possible amount of water. The
contract price for this steamer was $20,000, and it was launched in
June, 1858, about three months after the contract was let. It was built
at Freedom, Beaver county, Pennsylvania, not far from Pittsburg.

As to the subsequent history of this steamer, I shall confine myself to
press notices from the _Cedar Valley Times_, which will give you an
idea of the people and how much interest they took in this vessel,
which was to connect them with the outside world. From the issue of
July 8th, I find the following: "News has arrived that the 'Cedar
Rapids' left Pittsburg July 1st, with 100 tons of freight." From the
issue of July 22nd: "The 'Cedar Rapids' arrived from Pittsburg in three
weeks, and is around at the dock at Market St. Roman candles were sent
up from her decks when she arrived, and the crowd upon the shores
saluted her with renewed cheers and with a firing of cannons; below is
her Log: 'Left Pittsburg July 1st, at dark. At Cincinnati the 5th; at
Louisville the 8th; arrived at St. Louis the 12th; left the 15th;
arrived at the mouth of the Iowa river at 11 o'clock, and took in tow,
60,000 feet of lumber; five feet of water in the channel up to the
mouth of the Cedar river. Arrived at Moscow Friday evening. Consignees,
William Greene, W. B. Mack, H. C. Camp, groceries; L. Daniels, R. C.
Rock, Greene and Hay, hardware; W. W. Smith, O. O. Stanchfield,
lumber." The article further goes on describing the steamer as follows:
"She is 155 feet long, 26 feet wide, and three feet in the hold. She is
a stern wheel, 14 feet in diameter, 18 feet long, buckets being 15
inches wide. She is provided with a decker or smaller engine for
supplying the boiler with water, also with a smaller engine for
hoisting freight out of the hold. All four engines are separate
machines. She is also supplied with appliances, such as water gauge,
two Evans safety guides, one on each engine, life preservers, fire hose
and force pump, in short, everything to make her a first-class
passenger boat. The captain is J. M. Andrews, a gentleman who has had
much experience with river navigation; the pilot is Albert Wemper;
mate, T. Risley; engineers, J. P. Fulton and W. M. Hunter; clerks, J.
C. Graves, A. W. Lamb. She had on 300 tons of freight, and drew only
three feet of water, and when light, draws eleven inches. She had on
board eighty-four passengers."

The above description will give you an idea of the first passenger boat
of any note built for traffic in Iowa, and was no doubt at that time,
one of the best equipped steamers for passenger and freight traffic
owned exclusively by Iowa men and operated upon Iowa rivers.

On this steamer, which made its first trip in 1858, was W. B. Mack, a
person well known to Cedar Rapids people, and who for half a century,
up to the time of his death a few years ago, had been one of the most
active business men of our city, and in an early day did much in the
east in securing funds from the rich in various investments in this
city. Mr. Mack had come to this city in March of this year, at the
solicitation of Greene and Merritt, and he entered into a partnership
relation with said men in the banking business. He early saw the
opportunity for Cedar Rapids as a wholesale center, and purchased stock
in the steam ship company, went east in June, purchased a stock of
groceries in New York City, had them transported by rail to Pittsburg,
and personally saw that they were properly stored on the "Cedar
Rapids." On the route he made a purchase of a considerable cargo of
Kenawha salt. All of which were shipped to Cedar Rapids, and was the
first exclusive wholesale stock of groceries in this city. This had an
effect of reducing the price of salt from $5 per barrel, to one-half,
and it had the further effect of reducing the price of nearly every
commodity, so that Cedar Rapids, on account of its transportation
facilities, became known as a cheap trading center, and I believe has
retained that reputation up to the present time.

On this first trip of the "Cedar Rapids," came as a passenger from
Pittsburg, Susan H. Greene, better known to you, as Mrs. A. S. Belt. If
we could only have the impression of what this seventeen-year-old young
lady saw on this trip from Pittsburg to Cedar Rapids, in the '50s,
along this historic waterway, we should undoubtedly have at least a
chapter of the history of the country and of the life of the people as
she observed it, and it would no doubt make a valuable addition to the
history of this county.

The "Cedar Rapids" made in all, twelve trips during the season, to St.
Louis, stopping at every point along the way to pick up cargo or
passengers. In this respect, the captain was much like President
Stickney, of the Great Western, who replied to the manager of an
electric road the other day, wanting certain traffic relations
established, that he would stop for a farm wagon, providing there was
anything in it. Of the Cedar Rapids business men, who, during this time
received large shipments of goods from time to time, I note the
following: A. C. Keyes, J. S. Cook, A. H. Atwell, H. C. Camp, H. G.
Angle, W. W. Smith Bros., Stanchfield, Taylor, Greene, and W. B. Mack.

From the issue of July 29th, I find the following: "The 'Cedar Rapids'
left for St. Louis yesterday, and had in tow, a barge loaded with 1,138
sacks of oats, 736 sacks of wheat, some corn and 938 barrels of flour.
At Rochester it will take on 200 barrels of flour. It had besides
twenty passengers. It was frequently difficult to get under the bridge
at Moscow, so a quantity of sand was taken on board at Cedar Rapids to
weigh the steamer down sufficiently to get under the bridge, when the
weight of the cargo was not sufficient." On October 14th, the newspaper
again mentioned the steamer having arrived from St. Louis with a good
cargo, the bulk of which was 45,000 feet of lumber, consigned to O. O.
Stanchfield and Gordon & Enos, the captain further reports low water
and numerous sand-bars.

The steamer seems to have run until about the middle of November, when
she was laid up at St. Louis, and was expected to have gone into winter
trade on the Red river. Dr. S. D. Carpenter and G. W. Hollet having
gone to New Orleans to make the arrangements. The newspaper for
December speaks of the parties having returned unable to book the
steamer for the winter trade on the Red river, as she was not
constructed properly for Southern trade.

Early in March of the following year the whistle of the "Cedar Rapids"
again greeted the denizens of this city, bringing a large cargo of
freight, leaving again on the 14th with 4,300 bushels of grain and
sixteen passengers. On this trip was one of our honored townsmen,
George Haman, who had come from Mifflin county, Pennsylvania, two years
previously, and who now was on his way to St. Louis to buy his first
stock of drugs. He returned in about ten days with a well selected
stock, and has been in active business in the same location ever since.
The officers this year were captain, B. Tay; clerk, G. W. Hollet, mate,
T. G. Isherwood, and pilot, Merrit. Mr. Haman speaks in glowing terms
of the fine treatment received while on board, of the luxurious
staterooms and of the magnificent table which was fit for a king. On
one of these trips certain machinery was broken at Rochester, and it
was thought that they had to go afoot to Muscatine to make the repairs
before the steamer could proceed further. A village blacksmith by the
name of Jim Grant, a cousin of the general, after looking over the
broken piston rods, said in his laconic way, "I'd rather pound away
here all summer, than have a man walk to Muscatine and back," and he
was as good as his word, for in the morning he had the damage repaired
and received a good day's wages and three cheers from the crew and the
passengers.

In the issue of May 5th, the paper mentioned the steamer "Cedar Rapids"
as departing from this city for Burlington with 9,000 bushels of grain
with A. W. Lamb as captain. This was the last trip the "Cedar Rapids"
made on Cedar river water, as by the issue of May 19th the paper speaks
of the "Cedar Rapids" sinking another steamer near Burlington. Mr.
Isherwood tells me, that the steamer which was sunk was called the
"Canton" and owned by John Roads of Savannah, Ill. The accident was due
to a mistake of signals. The injured parties held the "Cedar Rapids"
and a long litigation ensued, which was a severe blow to the
stockholders, who lost their steamer. The sound of the whistle of the
"Cedar Rapids" was never heard again, and it closes the chapter as far
as steam boating below the dam is concerned.

The day of steamboating was about over. A new method of transportation
was devised, and millions of dollars which had been spent by the state
and by the nation was now of but little account, and the grants of land
which had been made in order to improve the navigation of our river,
was now changed, and given in the extension of railroads. June 15,
1859, is the great gala day of Cedar Rapids, for it is on this day that
the last rail was laid which connected us with Chicago, and the far
East, and the celebration of this occasion is the most noted that we
have ever had up to the present time. There were orators from the East,
from the South and from the North, and the news of this celebration was
spread broadcast over the land and it seemed to have been of such a
flowery kind that it caused the waters of the Cedar to flow backwards,
and only Elias Doty has ever since that time succeeded in piloting a
steamboat on the murky waters of the Cedar, as far as Rochester.

As I have stated before, the dam across the Cedar was erected in 1842,
although Mrs. John F. Ely says the dam was never completed, and her
husband constantly spent large sums of money to keep it up, and it was
not long till quite a traffic was going on above the dam as far as
Cedar Falls. Early in 1858, T. G. Isherwood came from Brownsville,
Pennsylvania, the son of a boat builder, and he set to work to build
the first boat of any size for river traffic. It was built for Freeman
Smith & Co., and nearly all the lumber was sawed by Snouffer & Watrous
and came out of Bever Park. It made its trial trip on September 30,
1858. It was a stern wheeler, single deck, 125 feet long, 125 tons
burden, called the "Export." From the paper of October 7, I quote the
following: "The new steamer 'Export' made her trial trip up the river
last Friday, having on board some 70 or 80 of our citizens. She
performed well, and all on board were delighted with the trip. We are
happy to know that the whole community unite in awarding the owners,
Freeman Smith &. Co., much praise. The list of officers are as follows:
Master, Freeman Smith, Jr.; clerk, S. D. McCaulley; engineer, Tom
Stanley; mate, Tom G. Isherwood." The paper for the next few weeks
speaks in glowing terms of the "Export" and what a trade the merchants
of this city have worked up with the towns along the river. That the
boat makes the distance by river from Waterloo in fourteen hours and
from Vinton, in five hours. The Waverly _Republican_, then edited by
our townsman, J. O. Stewart, asks the people of Waverly and the
surrounding country to obtain their goods by way of Cedar Rapids, as
the cheapest and quickest method by which to get goods into that region
of the country.

Mr. Isherwood speaks of the boat doing a big business, both in freight
and passenger traffic, and that on the whole he did a paying business
for the short time it was in service. On this first trip, was enrolled
as a member of the crew, George Horridge, a young tinner, who had
recently come from the east, and who is now well and favorably known as
a banker and capitalist at Vinton. Marion Evans, now mayor of said
town, tells me of running a mile and a half to the river to see this
first steamer, and when he saw the smoke from the smoke-stack he hid
behind the hazelbrush thinking of the eruption of Vesuvius. The paper
of October 21st speaks of a picnic party having chartered the boat and
gone up the river, and among the names of those well and favorably
known to most of you, at least by name, I shall mention a few: George
Greene, Dr. S. D. Carpenter, Dr. Lyon, J. F. Ely, J. S. Cook, Rev.
Durley and ladies. During the winter the "Export" was sold to J. J.
Snouffer and W. D. Watrous. It was remodeled, called the "Blackhawk,"
and on March 16th made its first trip to Waterloo, with J. J. Snouffer
as captain and George A. Ohler as chief carpenter. Arriving at Vinton,
they were unable to get under the bridge, and threatened to destroy it.
A council of war was held and it was finally decided to elevate one
span of the bridge about four feet, and Ohler superintended the work.
Mr. Snouffer tells me that the biggest business the steamer did was on
June 15th, when he carried 107 passengers at $5.00 a head for round
trip for the Cedar Rapids celebration, including board and lodging. He
made in all, twenty-nine trips, and during this season, free of all
expenses, netted the owners $2,000. The "Blackhawk" as remodeled, was
110 feet long by 19 feet wide, and had two rows of berths on each side,
and accommodated 24 passengers, besides a crew of seven people. It took
four cords of wood per trip. The table of distances by river compiled
by the pilot on the "Blackhawk" is as follows: Palo, 14-1/2 miles;
Benton City, 42 miles; Vinton, 50 miles; La Porte, 82 miles, and
Waterloo, 113 miles. It was sold to Burley & Durlin, and the owners
accepted one-half of the purchase price in land. The cash was never
paid, and attachment was gotten out for labor claims and the boat was
sold for $19.00. It was sold to a preacher, at Western, who threw up
the deal, and again the boat was sold to N. B. Brown and John Curliss,
the entire purchase price being paid in woolen goods. On account of dry
season, the boat was sent south and was sold by the owners to the
government for $6,000 during the war, and was used for carrying
provisions for the soldiers on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers. At
one time some of the Linn county soldier boys saw the little steamer
make its way up one of the rivers, and a yell went up for the old
"Blackhawk." The sight of the steamer brought them nearer home.

On one of the trips Mr. Snouffer made that summer, the wife of the
fireman, who was acting as maid, was taken ill and the captain sent two
doctors who were passengers to examine her. After a hurried examination
both came up very much excited, stating that the patient was suffering
from spotted fever and for him to stop the boat that they wanted to
get off at all hazards. Mr. Snouffer thought perhaps of damages and
financial loss so he was in no hurry to comply, but took the husband
and went into the small cabin up next to the smoke-stack to investigate
for himself. There was the woman in great stress of mind and much
worried. He took hold of her hand and tried to rub the spots out and
sure enough it was found that during the night the coloring in the
cotton goods had colored her arms and the headache was no doubt due to
the stuffy room and extremely warm quarters. It is needless to say that
for the rest of the trip the doctors were made the butt of ridicule by
the passengers.

The "Surprise" freighted between this city and Vinton in '63 and the
next steamer was known as the "Nettie Munn," being a stern wheeler 70
feet long and 12 feet wide, and was brought here from Wisconsin by Mr.
Passmore in 1866, and was blown up at Kelsey's landing the following
year. Another steamer was built by E. Robins and used as a ferry boat,
and in the wool and lime trade, but was never fully equipped, and was
sunk many years ago. The "Carrie Wallace" was built by W. G. Brock in
about 1870; was 16x40, a stern wheeler without state rooms, and was
used mostly to tow barges, excursion steamers, etc., and was blown up
about 1879-80. The "Kitty Clyde" was run awhile and abandoned. John
Kozlovsky built the "Rose" in the early days, and after a steamboat
venture on the river, was minus several thousand dollars, but had
gained a heap of experience in the meantime. The boiler of the "Rose"
was shipped to Solon to be placed in the grist mill, and the engine was
sent to Spirit Lake, while Captain Elias Doty bought the hull for a
mere song in 1884. In this "Rose" hull, Capt. Doty installed the
boilers of an abandoned steamer, the "Carrie Wallace," and into it he
also installed the engine of an old freighter, called "General Weaver."
This combination, Doty called the "Climax." A stock company was
organized with the amount of $1,000 and is the only stock known on
record which never at any time went below par. Doty put in $600, and
his Cedar Rapids friends the balance. He says that he was not out any
interest as he had the money in the bank when he started. He was out
only his time, but he didn't count that much, as he had all the time
there was, and a whole lot of fun in the bargain. It is true, he lost
the principal, but then the captain consoles himself with the fact that
he might have lost that anyway. The "Climax" was not the only boat the
"Governor" ran, for a number of years he had a side wheeler called the
"Khedive" and another boat named after his patron saint of greenback
days and called the "General Weaver." After his exploits upon the river
the captain, like the snail, carried his house with him, and for a
number of years, one of the hulls of one of his stranded boats is said
to have served him as a photograph gallery.

There had been more or less trouble growing out of the fact that this
river and the Iowa, which seems to have been known as one stream, were
navigable, as the people preferred bridges and dams to open river
fronts. In an Act of Congress passed May 6, 1870, the following
appears: "That so much of the same river as lies north of the town of
Wapello be and the same is hereby declared not a navigable stream."
Another act was passed on the 18th day of August, 1894, to the effect
that "so much of the same river as lies between the town of
Toolsborough and Wapello in Louisa county, Iowa, shall not be deemed a
navigable stream, but dams and bridges may be constructed across it."
Thus it would seem that the Iowa and Red Cedar rivers for nearly the
entire distance in Iowa are not navigable so far as Congress has the
right and power to enact such laws, which of course merely refer to
whether or not such streams may be used for other purposes than
navigation.

After all, the story of steamboating is a history of a struggle, which
began under auspicious circumstances, and ended in financial failure,
but for all that, it made a new Cedar Rapids, and we perhaps today, are
profiting by the failures of half a century ago, for it shows what
energy and public spirit its first citizens had, which left an
impression upon the community and upon the state. We must bear in mind,
that Cedar Rapids had only 2,000 people and the county less than
18,000, when these enterprising men of energy, perseverance and thrift
put $20,000 into a hazardous undertaking, and even presented passengers
and crew with corner lots on arrival.

Well might the first passenger have said, when he stepped off the
steamboat landing, at Third avenue, much like Moore said of Washington
a hundred years ago,

     "An embryo capital where fancy sees,
     Squares in morasses and obelisks in trees,"

but the observing traveler, amid these crude surroundings, must have
been alive to new impressions, for Cedar Rapids was a thrifty place,
even then, where the new man was a pilot on a boat today, and a banker
tomorrow, and although the waters of the Cedar henceforth ran quietly
by, unhindered by paddle or screw, railroad building claimed the
attention of its people, and they became equally at home on land, as
they had been on water. Just the other day I asked one of your old
settlers why they could keep up several newspapers in that day, really
before they had a postoffice. The venerable ex-postmaster replied with
fire in his eye, "Why, heavens sakes my man, it took three newspapers
to keep up the town."

I have attempted to give you an idea of steamboating on the Red Cedar.
I have omitted much, and can only say in the words of the old miller,
that he sees not all the water that goes by his mill. Neither have I
mentioned all the steamboat ventures on the beautiful Cedar.

In this connection it is of interest to note a report made by B. L.
Wick to Lew W. Anderson, chairman of the River Front Improvement
Commission of Cedar Rapids, under date of May 8, 1909, which report was
later submitted to the authorities at Washington, and an appropriation
made for a survey of the Cedar. The survey was made in 1909, and report
submitted that it was not feasible without a large expenditure of money
to make the river navigable except for a short distance from its mouth.

     Dear Sir:

     I have been requested to state my views on the
     practicability and the importance of the navigability of the
     Cedar river, and will say that for the past ten years I have
     devoted more or less study to this subject from a historic
     standpoint, and will herewith give you my views. I believe
     that what you want more than anything else is whether or not
     the Cedar river has been navigated formerly, whether or not
     the rainfall is the same as it used to be, and whether or
     not there is at present a demand for the opening of this
     river as a water way for transportation purposes.

     Historically speaking, traffic on the Cedar river was an
     epoch making period of this section of the country in the
     early pioneer days, and the prosperity of Cedar Rapids and
     other cities was due in a large measure to the river traffic
     which in those days made, at least, this city what it later
     became.

     The first notice we have of a white man exploring what is
     known as the "Red Cedar River" was by Col. George Davenport
     as early as 1831 when he established a trading post, at Rock
     Creek. The first steamboating on the Des Moines river was
     about in 1837, and from this time on the Des Moines, the
     Iowa and Red Cedar became the inland water ways by which
     grain was exported and freight was brought up from the
     cities on the Mississippi river. As early as 1839 the
     legislature of Iowa territory empowered a company to
     incorporate in the amount of $200,000.00 to build a slack
     water canal from the Cedar river to the Mississippi river by
     way of what is known as "Rock Creek," and while this project
     did not come to anything, it shows that the people of this
     early day believed in a public water way in order to come in
     contact with the towns along the river further up.

     The Red Cedar river is about 248 miles long and is
     comparatively free from any rapids as far as Cedar Rapids,
     and hence was early looked upon as one of the most favored
     rivers for steam boat navigation. The Iowa river, into which
     the Cedar river empties, is about 240 miles in length and is
     not so favorable for navigation. One of the early settlers
     who first saw the use of this inland water way was Robert
     Ellis, who came to these parts in 1838 and who is still
     living, and who, as early as 1846, caused three flat boats
     to be built, each boat being about sixty feet in length,
     sixteen feet in width and only drew three feet of water when
     loaded. On these boats he loaded 4,000 bushels of wheat
     consigned to certain millers at Burlington; at Burlington he
     unloaded the wheat and loaded the same boats with a cargo of
     flour which was duly taken to New Orleans. From this time on
     much wheat, corn, bacon, and other articles were shipped
     from Cedar Rapids to Burlington, Keokuk, St. Louis, and
     other places on the Mississippi.

     It is also true that Mr. Haman, one of the oldest druggists
     of this city, went to St. Louis for his first stock of drugs
     and these were brought back by water.

     W. B. Mack, one of the early settlers, and one of the first
     wholesale grocers, secured a cargo of salt in Ohio, which
     was duly freighted to Cedar Rapids and caused a decline in
     the price of this commodity in the amount of $5.00 a barrel.

     It is known that as early as 1839 keel boats had reached
     Ivanhoe, and quite a trade was carried on at certain seasons
     of the year. The first Mississippi steamer which came as far
     as our city limits was in the month of June, 1846, called
     "The Maid of Iowa," when a number of settlers came this way
     as land seekers and at a time when each passenger was
     offered a lot by the enterprising people of this city.
     During the next ten years many large and many small steamers
     made the Cedar river towns as far as Cedar Rapids, and quite
     a trade had been established between St. Louis, Keokuk,
     Burlington, and other cities. One of the large Mississippi
     steamers of 200 tons burden was "The Uncle Tobey," which
     made her way up here among the brush and hanging willows in
     the spring of 1853, having on board a large cargo of
     freight.

     To show how much importance the river was to the early
     settlers it might be well to state that in the fifties--in
     about 1857--a contract was entered into for the building of
     a steamer about 155 feet long, single deck, stern wheel,
     clinker built, to be arranged for freight and passenger
     traffic and to draw the least possible amount of water. The
     contract price of this steamer was $20,000.00, and it was
     launched in June, 1858, and was put into service, arriving
     at Cedar Rapids July 22, having arrived from Pittsburg in
     three weeks, stopping at all the cities along the way; this
     boat had on board about three hundred tons of freight, drew
     only three feet of water, and had on board nearly one
     hundred passengers. This was, undoubtedly, the best built
     passenger and freight boat put on Iowa rivers at that time;
     during that season this boat made in all twelve trips. On
     the first trip down stream on July 29, of that year, the
     papers show that she was loaded down and had in tow a barge
     loaded with 1,138 sacks of oats, 736 sacks of wheat, some
     corn, and nearly 1,000 barrels of flour. On one of the trips
     in October up stream this boat had on board 45,000 feet of
     lumber; in the following summer this boat got into a
     collision with another steamer on the Mississippi, and on
     account of a lawsuit the boat was tied up by litigation.

     For a number of years a profitable steamboat business was
     carried on in the spring of the year above the dam between
     Cedar Rapids, Vinton, Waterloo and other places. The early
     settlers all agree that navigation was possible in those
     days and profitable as well. It was just at this time when
     steamboating became certain and settled that the railroad
     entered Cedar Rapids in June, 1859, and from that time every
     enterprise which was started was in the line of railway
     extension as well as transportation.

[Illustration: PARK VIEWS IN CEDAR RAPIDS]

     As to the rain fall, it seems that there has not been much
     difference between the rains of sixty years ago and now. I
     collected the following from the _Annals of Iowa_, Volume 5,
     page 401, being the rain fall from 1848 to 1855.

     In 1848, 26 inches; 1849, 49 inches; 1850, 49 inches; 1851,
     71 inches; 1852, 49 inches; 1853, 45 inches; 1854, 23
     inches; 1855, 28 inches.

     From this the average rain fall of Iowa, I believe, is
     estimated at about 33 inches. It would appear from 1858 the
     rain fall was below the average, while during the years up
     to 1858 the rain fall was above the average. From the
     newspapers that I have consulted in regard to the rain fall
     during these years it seemed that there were a good many
     floods during the summer months so that the steamboating was
     good until about November, when the boats were taken down
     south for winter traffic on the southern rivers. As to the
     rain fall, I have further investigated among the old
     settlers, and from reports which were kept, it seems that
     there is not very much difference in the rain fall now and
     fifty years ago; however, there is this difference, which
     all agree on, that the channel of the river was more narrow
     and that the river was deeper and free from mud and sand,
     which has now accumulated due to the tilling of the soil.
     The river banks were lined with trees which protected the
     water from the rays of the sun, and the sloughs were filled
     with water all summer on account of the high grass, and
     these grasses and sloughs supplied the river with water more
     so then than now, as more of it evaporated on account of the
     tilling of soil and on account of the cutting of the grass
     than formerly. All the water which fell in those days found
     its way into the river, which is not true after the ground
     became cultivated to any extent, and it may be true that
     only one-fourth of the water which falls now finds its way
     into the river.

     Another question may arise "is it practical?" This is a
     question not easily answered. It is certain that it can not
     be done through private enterprise; if it shall succeed at
     all it must be through state or government aid in part, at
     least. There is no question but what it will be useful, but
     whether or not the expenses would be too great to undertake
     such an enterprise--that remains a debatable question. There
     is water enough in the river, especially by putting in a dam
     at Moscow and by straightening the channel a little, so that
     there will be enough water for the number of months during
     the year to haul much of our heavy freight, and, if
     necessary, these products could be stored further along the
     river until such a time as it was deemed advisable to sell
     and dispose of the same. Heavy freight requires slow transit
     and a cheap rate, and such can as well go by water as by
     rail. For this reason it would be possible to ship by water,
     grain, cereals, as well as cattle, and there would be a
     great saving to the farmers of this part of Iowa.

     A conservative estimate of freight paid in Cedar Rapids
     during the past year is no less than $2,500,000.00, all of
     which is paid to five railroads which have connecting lines
     in this city. It is also estimated, and I have been told on
     good authority, that during October, 1908, the tonnage
     receipts in this city were as follows for the Rock Island
     railroad:

          Live stock         4,638,800 pounds
          Coal              14,659,303 pounds
          Brick                383,900 pounds
          Stone              1,603,200 pounds

     These are only a few of the larger items and there are a
     great many more of nearly equal importance with those cited
     above. There has also been shipped out in farm and dairy
     products for the year ending 1908 from

          Linn county        1,980,218 pounds
          Cedar county         733,708 pounds
          Benton county        451,297 pounds
          Black Hawk county        1,032,444 pounds
          Buchanan county          1,980,218 pounds

     These are a few of the items from the counties which are
     tributory to this river.

     For the year 1907 I will mention the yield of a few cereals
     in counties adjoining the Cedar river, to-wit:

Buchanan county      1,942,750 bushels corn      1,011,000 bushels oats
Benton county        3,686,100 bushels corn      1,842,800 bushels oats
Linn county          3,851,500 bushels corn      1,166,160 bushels oats
Johnson county       3,415,170 bushels corn      1,231,100 bushels oats
Cedar county         3,211,230 bushels corn        804,500 bushels oats

     Say nothing of hay, potatoes, barley, wheat, rye and other
     products.

     Such a water course would also offer inducement to
     manufacturing concerns for the manufacture of cereals, etc.,
     which are shipped out in carload lots daily, as well as
     grain which is cleaned here and sent out to other cities.
     This will give you somewhat of an idea, not only of the
     value and productiveness of Iowa soil, but to show the
     chances of such a water way by which freight products could
     be handled at a much lower rate than at present, as we have
     here the same freight rate as they have at Council Bluffs,
     and by this means we would get the Mississippi rate, which
     is much less. Such a water way would open up the heart of
     the corn and oats belt of Iowa and make it possible to get
     the water rate on large shipments of freight. If the
     government is now urging a water way enterprise, surely the
     Cedar river should not be overlooked, for it is a large body
     of water, with a rich adjoining territory, and by government
     promotion could be made the carrier of all our products
     which, as above set out, means millions in bushels annually.

     It is not likely that the freight shipped into our city
     would come by water, as it is generally of a kind which is
     wanted quickly, but there is no question but that the
     products of our farmers, and all our mills and factories,
     would be sent by water, on account of cheaper rates to
     better markets than now.

     It is only when I visited other countries and studied
     transportation from cities in England, Holland, Belgium,
     France and Germany that I realized the small rivers of those
     countries which have been used for centuries to such an
     advantage for the carriage of freight. For instance, a river
     of any size is dredged to a certain depth at government
     expense; there is a uniform depth of a little better than
     three feet of water on many of these rivers, and on these
     bodies of water barges of not less than 1,000 tons pass up
     and down loaded with freight. This means cheaper freight
     rates than we have and this in consequence makes products
     cheaper to the consumer and higher for the producer. Canada,
     during the past few years, has spent millions of dollars on
     its rivers and canals, and it is money wisely spent; while
     we have spent little or nothing in any effort to help the
     people in the promotion of water ways, which will be the
     real source of competition in freight rates in the future.

     I fully believe that the survey of the Cedar should be made,
     and I believe that if such a survey is made that this stream
     will be declared navigable, and that the state or nation
     will step in in order to make definite plans for financing
     this great enterprise for the carrying on of freight
     steamers, carrying cargoes as far as the Mississippi, and I
     believe that enough tariff exists now to warrant such an
     enterprise. The Cedar river is an important factor now for
     the purpose of furnishing power, and should also become a
     factor in transportation as well. This would be the case
     provided the river would be improved as demanded, which
     would result in re-establishing heavy freight traffic by
     water instead of as now wholly by rail.




CHAPTER XLI

_Banks and Banking in Linn County_


The history of banking in Cedar Rapids and Linn county may
appropriately be divided into three periods, designated respectively,
Frontier Banking, Country Banking, and City Banking, each possessing
characteristics peculiar to itself and expressive of its time.

Frontier Banking was coincident with the beginning of business in Iowa,
and continuing, covered the pioneer days, prior to the coming of the
railroad, and its story is most interestingly told in his own words by
Dr. S. D. Carpenter, whose youthful activities were a part of that
early life, and who, in his eightieth year, writes as follows:

     "Something over fifty years ago, as I recall the
     circumstance, I was greatly elated when the local printer at
     Cedar Rapids produced a card on which was imprinted
     'Carpenter, Lehman & Co., Bankers.' At an earlier period of
     my life, I had read _AEsop's Fables_, but if I had, the story
     of the Ass who paraded in the Lion's skin did not seem
     applicable, and I mingled boldly with my companions, who,
     with equal effrontery, wore the same apparel. The
     'protoplasm' from which the bankers of that day evoluted was
     plentiful and the environment all that could be desired. In
     a technical sense, it is quite true, there was no necessity
     for a bank and no business for a banker; there being no
     commerce, there were no bills to discount; but nevertheless,
     we established banks and became bankers. This was possible,
     because we had squatted down in the midst of millions of
     acres of a very fertile soil, in a genial and healthy
     climate. The product of land could not be exported, but a
     large immigration was pouring into the country, hungry for
     land and sufficiently numerous to consume all the surplus
     products. Land was the basis of all the live business, and
     the land agent and real estate dealer evoluted naturally
     into a banker. Land warrants took the place of commodities,
     dealers in the east collected them, and sent them to their
     agents in the west, who sold them at a large advance to the
     immigrants for whom they entered the land. The western real
     estate dealer ordinarily did not have capital enough to buy
     the land warrant, but handled it on a commission for his
     eastern correspondent until such time as he could accumulate
     from his profits sufficient cash to buy it outright. The
     price of the land warrant as purchased from the party to
     whom issued, was less than one dollar per acre, and was
     always sold to the buyer who used it at $1.25 per acre, that
     is a profit of at least 25 cents per acre, and with the
     continual increase of immigrants the business became of
     great volume and was correspondingly remunerative. Often the
     purchaser wanted more land than he had cash to pay for; then
     the real estate man sold the warrant at the rate of $1.25
     per acre, took the purchaser's note for the balance at three
     per cent per month interest and held all the land as
     security. At this point, the real estate man became a
     banker. The first real estate firm in Cedar Rapids was that
     of Weare, Finch & Co., consisting of John Weare, Jr., Daniel
     O. Finch, and George Greene. They began business either in
     1850 or 1851. I was offered a one-fourth interest in the
     syndicate for $500.00 and would gladly have taken it, but
     was unable to raise the requisite capital. Although unable
     to break into the crib, like many others, I hung around and
     was able now and then to grab an ear from the overflow. In
     other words, I became a customer of the bank. Being in the
     practise of medicine, I became familiar with all the
     surrounding country. When I discovered a choice location as
     regarded timber, water, etc., I went to the bank, bought a
     land warrant at $1.25 per acre, gave my note at three per
     cent per month, with a cast iron mortgage, and took my
     chances in the hope of selling at an advance before the
     maturity of the note. I was so successful in these ventures
     that I soon abandoned my profession and devoted my whole
     time to real estate. The real estate operator took advantage
     of the fact that many of the immigrants brought money with
     them, which it required time to invest. They had to look up
     locations to enter or to examine tracts which they desired
     to buy at second hand. Meantime, they did not wish to carry
     their money about with them and therefore they deposited it
     in the bank. The trade of the local merchants also
     increased, and they gradually became customers, and from
     these sources came the deposits. The volume of exchange was
     small, but the bank added something to its income by acting
     as agent for the payment of taxes for non-residents. The
     firm of Weare, Finch & Co. soon merged into that of Greene &
     Weare, D. O. Finch removing to Des Moines to establish a
     branch of the same house. Greene & Weare did not long enjoy
     a monopoly at Cedar Rapids. B. S. Bryan, who had been a
     clerk in their house, and had become familiar with the
     business, with a brother-in-law named Ward, from New Jersey,
     opened a rival establishment under the name of Ward & Bryan,
     some time in 1852 or '53. At that time, the immigration was
     so large that both establishments had all the business they
     could manage with their limited capital. It is not probable
     that either concern was very conservative, but the newer
     firm had but little capital, and the members branched out in
     the way of building new residences for themselves, and Bryan
     went so far as to buy a top buggy and a fine horse. This was
     going beyond the limit; the pioneer whose aspirations in the
     way of a pleasure carriage did not extend beyond a two horse
     wagon, became suspicious. Some renewals of paper in Iowa
     City and Davenport were refused them, and they had to close
     their doors. Then ensued a mild financial earthquake, which
     did not affect the town itself, because no one in the town,
     except the merchants, had any money on deposit, and they but
     little, but the sufferers were those who had put their money
     in the bank preparatory to buying land, and the bankers of
     whom they had bought land warrants on credit. Wm. Greene and
     myself, were appointed receivers. The assets amounted to
     about $35,000.00 and the indebtedness to something more. It
     took a year or two to close up the business and there was
     not a very great loss to any one.

[Illustration: IN AND AROUND MT. VERNON]

     "The town had scarcely quieted down from this excitement
     before it was struck by another financial cyclone of an
     entirely different character. We had a mail three times a
     week from Dubuque to Iowa City, the service being performed
     by four horse Concord coaches; it was before the day of the
     express companies. All money and other valuable packages
     came by mail. One day about 9 o'clock in the morning, the
     postmaster from Marion dashed into town at full speed,
     bringing the alarming intelligence that a mail pouch had
     been stolen from the coach in Marion, which had been found
     cut open and rifled and then concealed in some shavings back
     of a carpenter shop, near the hotel where the stage stopped
     to change horses and allow the passengers to breakfast. In
     the sack and near it, concealed in the shavings, were
     letters, and a package of land warrants, amounting to
     several thousand dollars. What was missing was not known.
     The land warrants were addressed to Greene & Weare. A crowd
     gathered about the bank and it soon became known that a
     money package had been in the pouch, but the amount was not
     given. Soon the report spread about that the bank had lost
     five, ten, or twenty thousand dollars, the sum varying
     according to the guessing power of the relator. Immediately
     John Weare and Wm. Greene started post haste to Marion,
     where they found a high state of excitement. The town had
     resolved itself into a committee of 'Sherlock Holmeses,' all
     devoting themselves to detective business. As a starting
     point, they were told that the money consisted of bank
     notes, issued by the Bank of Elgin, Illinois. Suspicion soon
     pointed to a disreputable blacksmith, living in a small
     frame house nearby. The stage had arrived at the hotel just
     before daylight, first driving to the postoffice, where the
     driver thought he had thrown all the sacks from the boot,
     but the small one had escaped his notice. The stage stood in
     front of the hotel and the horses were taken to the stable
     and fresh ones brought to supply their places. While this
     was being done and the passengers being at their breakfast,
     the stage was quite deserted, and it was then, it still
     being dark, that the thief got in his work. The stage
     proceeded on its way, and it was not till the carpenter
     shop, which stood just across the street from the hotel, was
     opened up for work, that a workman discovered the papers
     scattered about and finally the pouch itself. The alarm was
     at once given and the postmaster, as stated, carried the
     news to Cedar Rapids. It was not known that money had been
     stolen till Mr. Weare and Mr. Greene arrived. Soon after
     their arrival it became known that the blacksmith, quite
     early in the day, had been to the town grocery and much to
     the surprise of the grocer, paid up a standing account, and
     bought several dollars' worth of goods, for which he paid
     cash, with bills of the Bank of Elgin. These bills had not
     been in general circulation, and the grocer was making
     inquiries about them, which at once fixed suspicion on the
     blacksmith, who was immediately arrested and a guard placed
     about his house. He was searched, but nothing of an
     incriminating nature found. The house was then thoroughly
     gone over, and a five dollar bill of the Bank of Elgin found
     in the crack in the wall behind a looking glass. The man
     declared his innocence, and the woman said she knew nothing
     about the discovered bill. They had three children, a boy
     about thirteen, another eight, and a younger girl. In
     explanation of the bills paid the grocer, he said a man from
     Illinois, where he had formerly lived, had passed through
     the town the day before, and had paid him a bill of long
     standing in the bank notes that he had given the grocer.
     This story they stuck to, through all sorts of cross
     examination. Another diligent search of the house and
     adjacent premises was made, but nothing found. People living
     in the house nearest them, said that before daylight they
     had heard them up, and saw a light in the house, which was
     an unusual circumstance. The eldest boy, however, explained
     that he was raising a pet pig by hand, and that he was up so
     early because his pig was hungry and he had to feed it.
     Things went on in this manner till nearly night, when a new
     clew was struck. A woman living at the outskirts of the
     village had seen the eldest boy pass her house about eight
     or nine o'clock in the morning, carrying a sack, which
     apparently had something in it. No one had, however, seen
     him leave or return to his father's house, and he was there
     when the arrest was made, but the time that he was seen
     corresponded to about the time the grocer was being examined
     about the bills, and the detectives concluded that the
     blacksmith had his eyes open and surmised that they were
     getting warm on the trail, and had then sent out the boy
     with the money in the sack. The boy stoutly denied that he
     had left the house and that the woman was mistaken. So the
     matter rested for the first night. The next morning two
     other persons were found who had seen the boy and the sack
     at the time mentioned. Then the boy being hard pressed
     confessed that his mother had sent him out to a neighboring
     farm to get meal, but not finding any he had left the sack.
     Mr. Greene took the boy to the farm, but the people said he
     had not been there. Then he was brought back and again cross
     examined. He told numerous and conflicting stories, which I
     have forgotten, but succeeded in baffling the detectives the
     whole day. In the afternoon, Mr. Weare wrote me from Marion
     a very despairing note, saying that they were perfectly sure
     that the blacksmith was the thief, but that there was no
     clue to the money, which was the main thing, and suggesting
     that I bring three or four determined men and join him, and
     try by intimidation, whether it was not possible to frighten
     him into giving it up. I acted upon his advice and joined
     him in Marion about nightfall.

     "I found him at the house of his mother-in-law in company
     with a couple of dozen of the amateur detectives. They were
     awaiting the return of Wm. Greene, whom the boy was leading
     another wild goose chase. It was the consensus of opinion
     that if the last effort with the boy failed, the crowd
     should take the old man from the jail and threaten to lynch
     him. This might possibly make him confess. I felt perfectly
     sure that the boy had taken the money in the sack and
     concealed it and argued that it would be more easy to
     intimidate him than his father, who seemed to be hardened
     and determined. Objection was made on account of his age,
     and on the score of cruelty, but they finally agreed that I
     might make a trial on the boy, and that in case of failure,
     they would deal with the old man. Pending the discussion,
     William Greene and the boy drove up in a buggy. The boy had
     added another to his many lies about the disposition of the
     sack. He was a sturdy chap of thirteen, and under the
     embarrassing circumstances seemed pretty cool. When they got
     out of the buggy William Greene made a final appeal to him.
     'My boy,' he said, 'you have been lying to us all day as you
     well know, but I will make a last offer to you. If you will
     tell where you have hidden the money, I will give you
     $200.00 and you shall not be hurt, or anything done to you,
     but if you don't, I will turn you over to these men, and I
     don't know what they will do to you.' The boy said, 'that as
     true as there was a God in heaven, he didn't know anything
     about the money, and could tell nothing.' Then I took up the
     role; I seized him by the throat and threw him pretty
     heavily to the ground, and called for a rope; the crowd had
     a rope prepared for the old man, which was immediately put
     about his neck; then I raised him up and told them to throw
     the rope over the limb of a tree under which we were
     standing. They did so and drew it taut, and I said, 'now you
     lying young rascal, we are going to hang you instantly, and
     if you have anything to say, this is your last chance.' The
     suddenness of the attack, and the jar he received in falling
     sort of dazed him; at all events he cried out, 'don't hang
     me and I will tell.' He at once confessed that he had the
     money in the sack, and had buried it in a clump of bushes
     within three hundred yards of where we were. I led him by
     the rope, followed by the crowd, and in a few minutes a
     couple of the men unearthed the sack. We then returned to
     the house, the money was counted and only a few hundred
     dollars was missing from the original $6,000.00 which the
     package contained. The boy in the meantime had regained his
     courage, and on being asked to explain who gave him the
     money, said that while going with the sack for the meal
     early in the morning of the robbery, he had met two men, who
     gave him the money and told him to bury it and they would
     call in a few days and pay him $200.00 for his trouble, and
     that his father had nothing to do with it, and knew nothing
     about it. Asked to describe the men, he looked at the crowd
     and gave a very accurate description of myself and John
     Weare, who stood beside me. The bystanders appreciated the
     joke, and inquired whether Weare and I were not the men. He
     gave us another look and said he was not quite certain, but
     they were men who looked mightily like us, if we were not
     the very men.

     "The old man was kept in jail but the boy was left with his
     mother. In a few weeks the prisoner escaped, the boy having
     with an axe one night dug a hole in the wall of the jail. He
     and his father were heard of no more, and were never brought
     to justice. I have always had a sneaking sort of an
     admiration for that boy and feel certain that he must have
     reached distinction in some way or another.

     "The above episode took place, if my memory is not at fault,
     about 1854-5, and at that time and on till 1857, the real
     estate dealers and bankers throve apace. Personally I had
     arrived at a position that I thought entitled me to become a
     financier, and in company with L. H. Lehman, of Wooster,
     Ohio, and E. C. Kreider, of Lancaster, Ohio, we opened our
     doors and proclaimed ourselves bankers under the firm name
     of Carpenter, Lehman & Co. Soon afterwards another bank was
     started, the firm name of which I have forgotten, but of it
     Henry Wood, an early settler of the town, was a member. Thus
     Cedar Rapids, with a population of less than 2,000, could
     boast of three banks. Meantime Greene & Weare grew apace,
     and besides the home institution, within a few years they
     established branches in Des Moines, Council Bluffs, Omaha,
     Ft. Dodge, Sioux City, and it may be at other places, and in
     almost every county seat that I can think of there were two
     or three banks. Cook & Sargeant, of Davenport, were the
     Pierpont Morgans of the day, and had even more branches than
     Greene & Weare.

     "I cannot remember that there were any banks of issue in
     Iowa, nor do I know what the banking laws of Iowa were at
     that time, but if there were any, they were not so favorable
     as those of the territory of Nebraska. Cook & Sargeant, I
     believe, were the discoverers of the new field, and
     organized a bank at an obscure town in that territory named
     Florence, and very soon currency of the Bank of Florence was
     in active circulation; to keep abreast of the times, Greene
     & Weare started a bank at Fontanelle, a still more obscure
     place in the territory, and bills of the Bank of Fontanelle
     were greatly in evidence. I do not remember what provisions
     were made for the redemption of the notes, but imagine that
     the holders had a pretty tedious journey to get to the
     places of issue. They however did duty as money, made times
     good, and stimulated speculation. When the land office was
     opened at Fort Dodge, I made a trip to that place with John
     Weare, Jr., who went, I think, to establish a branch there.
     The journey consumed several days, and on arriving we found
     all the buildings that had formerly been occupied by the
     soldiers filled to overflowing with land seekers and
     bankers. Not only were the old buildings full, but many were
     in hastily built cabins, and even in tents. There were seven
     banks in full operation; one in a tent which served as a
     background for a large sign, announcing that ten per cent
     would be paid on current deposits. John Garaghty, of
     Lancaster, Ohio, an old friend of mine, had his bank in one
     of the recently built cabins. I found him on the floor of
     the bank, diligently sewing at a bed tick, which was to
     garnish a bunk in one corner where he slept. He seemed
     cheerful, but animadverted severely on his competitor in the
     tent, whom he said was taking a rascally advantage in
     offering ten per cent interest. Things went on swimmingly
     for a couple of years. Immigration was large, lands advanced
     rapidly in price, with plenty of buyers; to make money one
     only had to buy real estate, so we all cheerfully used all
     our cash and credit in that line.

     "Without much warning, so far as I can remember, the hard
     times of 1857 struck us, as the stringency extended over the
     whole country. Our supplies were suddenly cut off. We that
     were wearing the 'Lion's skin' began to bray, and to take to
     the tall timber. Our firm fortunately had not gotten
     entirely beyond its depth, but it was in well up to the
     chin. By strenuous efforts we managed to pay our depositors
     and then divided our lands, and went out of business, as did
     the other concern which had started in about the time we
     did. Greene & Weare were left alone in the field, but their
     difficulties were great, and the firm was soon dissolved by
     the withdrawal of John Weare, Jr., whose place was taken by
     Wm. Merritt, and the name changed to Greene, Merritt & Co.
     That financial cyclone I should say wiped out at least
     one-half of the bankers of Iowa, and had they been asked why
     they failed, they could have answered in the laconic terms
     of John Thompson, the bank note reporter, to a similar
     question, 'for want of money.'

     "For a couple of years thereafter I devoted my whole time to
     real estate, trying to get rid of my holdings, which were
     more than I could comfortably carry. In 1859, or
     thereabouts, having gotten my affairs into better shape, I
     again embarked in the banking business, having for partners
     John Weare, Jr., and Henry B. Stibbs, both of whom had been
     with the firm of Greene & Weare, the former as a partner,
     the latter as cashier. The firm name was Carpenter, Stibbs
     & Co. Banking had then become more legitimate. The railroad
     had been completed to Cedar Rapids. Commission houses had
     been established. Grain, hogs, and cattle were shipped in
     carloads, which furnished bills for discount; merchants were
     on a firmer basis and did a larger business, and the
     deposits were of considerable volume: real estate and tax
     paying still had a place, but were inconsiderable.

     "Things in a commercial way went on pretty smoothly till the
     breaking out of the Civil war. At that time our currency
     consisted principally of bank notes from Wisconsin and
     Illinois, which were based mostly upon state and other bonds
     held by the banks which issued the notes. As these
     securities fluctuated so did the value of the notes. Those
     who held them wanted to deposit in the banks, and when a
     customer came in, the banker had to refer to Thompson's Bank
     Note Reporter to ascertain their value, and even when so
     determined, the risk of the banker was great, because of
     their liability to depreciate. I remember going to St.
     Louis, shortly after the war began to withdraw our account
     from a bank there, and I had to pay 13 per cent for a gold
     draft. Still we managed to worry along and I do not remember
     that many failures occurred. When the war broke out, Cedar
     Rapids raised a company for the first regiment, and as the
     state had no money, our bank furnished the funds to equip,
     maintain, and transport the company to Keokuk, where it was
     mustered into the service. From that time till I entered the
     army early in 1862, I had little to do with the bank. I was
     chairman of a committee of thirteen whose duty it was to
     encourage enlistments and the formation of companies for the
     service, and by subscription to raise money for bounties,
     till finally I went myself and was not mustered out till
     August, 1865.

     "From the time I left for the war, I had nothing to do
     actively with the banking business and have never since been
     behind a banking counter in an official capacity. What
     little knowledge I have of the early banking in Iowa, I
     gained there, but as Cedar Rapids was a typical town, I
     imagine that the banking done there was very similar to that
     done in all the other towns of the state.

     "After a lapse of forty-four years, one's memory is not
     reliable and you must therefore make liberal allowance for
     errors in date as well as other things. In writing I regret
     the want of old papers and other data, but have done the
     best I could under the circumstances.

                                  "Truly yours,

                                     "SEYMOUR D. CARPENTER."

The first constitution of Iowa made the following reference to banks:

     "The General Assembly shall provide for the organization of
     all other corporations, except those with Banking privileges,
     the creation of which is prohibited."

For this reason early banking was conducted as a purely private
enterprise, or as a branch of some bank incorporated in another state.

Prior to the adoption of the second constitution in 1857, it became
evident that the state was very much in need of a more stable banking
system, so provision was made for incorporated banks, when approved by
vote of the people and for "The State Bank of Iowa," which was
incorporated July 29, 1858, with power to establish branches and issue
circulating notes. Elihu Baker, a Cedar Rapids banker, was the first
secretary of the State Bank, and in time fifteen branches were
established at different points in the state.

Although none was located here, our business interests received
substantial benefit from the improved financial conditions that
resulted from a safe system and a sound currency.

With the coming of the railroad in 1859, Cedar Rapids entered the field
of commerce and forever put an end, not only to frontier banking, but
to one of the most wonderfully heroic, and, in some respects, beautiful
scenes of its human history--the pioneer life.

Country banking as conducted today, is less crude, more scientific, and
safer than in the time of which we write, but a fundamental condition
that has always made it a public necessity remains the same, namely, a
local community engaged in the activities of development, production,
and commerce.

It goes without saying that the banking needs of Cedar Rapids as a
railroad town were greater than ever before and several applications
were made for permission to establish a branch of the State Bank, none
of which, however, was successful.

This worthy institution itself proved to be short-lived, for the need
that brought it into existence was broader than Iowa and soon
crystallized into the National Bank Act, which was adopted by the
Federal Congress in 1863, and which provided for a National Bank
currency and effectually put an end to all other bank note issues, and
the State Bank of Iowa, having fulfilled its mission, redeemed its
notes and all other liabilities, and ceased to exist.

Although the national system met with much opposition on the part of
the larger state banks of New York and elsewhere, and had to overcome
prejudice in the minds of many people throughout the country, its
positive improvement on the old order of things was quickly apparent to
Cedar Rapids bankers, resulting in the establishment of two National
banks in 1864, and the race for charters illustrates a degree of
alertness and competition in those days that would do credit to the
chief of present day hustlers, and verified the old proverb, "the first
shall be last," for the First National Bank, with a capital of
$50,000.00, received charter No. 500 on August 23d, while the City
National Bank, with a capital of $100,000.00, received charter No. 483
on July 19th of that year and was the first to open its doors for
business. During the following year, the First National Bank increased
its capital to $100,000.00. Published reports, about the end of the
year 1865, show total deposits in both banks of nearly $150,000.00, and
the full limit of outstanding bank notes $90,000.00 each, thus promptly
and amply providing banking facilities for the rapid development that
followed the close of the Civil war.

City banking within the memory of our older bankers was practically
confined to the east and to a very few of the larger cities of the
country, and its development in Cedar Rapids and other cities of her
class illustrates the evolution of banking methods and evidences the
remarkable financial growth of Iowa and the west. In response to the
growing needs of jobbing and manufacturing lines, which were then in
their infancy, the Merchants National Bank was organized in 1881 by R.
D. Stephens. He was an exceptionally able banker, and his untimely
death in 1883 deprived the community of a strong force.

With the organization of the Cedar Rapids National Bank, which
succeeded the private banking business of G. F. Van Vechten in 1887,
there was inaugurated a systematic effort to encourage and build up a
business with country banks within this territory. Such deposits were
carried in moderate amounts before this, but were handled more as a
matter of necessary collections on account of the shipments of live
stock and grain to this center than as a permanent and profitable
branch of banking. It became evident at this time that the rapid
development of the state and of wholesale and manufacturing businesses
at this point was bringing Cedar Rapids into closer business relations
with many other towns, that currency and credit could be handled here
with equal safety and with greater profit and convenience than in the
distant east, and with population and wage earners increasing, the
savings banks assumed their most important place, and thus it came
about that city banking, like country banking, was the outgrowth of our
mutual business requirements and advantages. Its natural development
led to the organization of the Cedar Rapids Clearing House Association
in 1902, the designation by government authority of Cedar Rapids as a
reserve city for deposits of other national banks in 1903, and to the
existence of ten active banks today, holding total deposits of over
sixteen million dollars, and completes a record of banking safety that
has paid its depositors in full throughout its history.

THE CEDAR RAPIDS CLEARING HOUSE ASSOCIATION

The Cedar Rapids Clearing House Association was organized largely
through the efforts of R. T. Forbes, at that time cashier of the
Citizens National Bank, and J. M. Dinwiddie, cashier of the Cedar
Rapids Savings Bank. During the summer of 1902, Mr. Forbes and Mr.
Dinwiddie agitated the matter and in October of that year, as the
result of their efforts, a committee of Cedar Rapids bankers,
consisting of John T. Hamilton, J. M. Dinwiddie, Ralph Van Vechten,
James E. Hamilton, J. W. Bowdish, Lawson Daniels, E. W. Virden, E. M.
Scott, Ed. H. Smith, E. E. Pinney, and R. T. Forbes, visited Davenport
and investigated the workings of the clearing house association of that
city.

Following that visit to Davenport, a meeting of the representatives of
the banks of the city was held on November 3, 1902, at which meeting it
was formally resolved to form a local association. A constitution and
by-laws were adopted on November 6, 1902, and the clearing house was
regularly organized, with the following banks as members: Merchants
National, Cedar Rapids National, Citizens National, Cedar Rapids
Savings, Security Savings, American Trust and Savings, People's
Savings. The first officers, elected December 3, 1902, were: President,
J. M. Dinwiddie; first vice-president, E. M. Scott; second
vice-president, Ed. H. Smith; treasurer, E. W. Virden; secretary and
manager, R. T. Forbes.

After formal organization the clearing house lay dormant for several
months and it was not until January 4, 1904, that the association
actually began the work of daily clearings. The clearings for the first
day amounted to a total of $127,000. The average per week for the first
year was about $400,000. That the banking business of Cedar Rapids has
grown with giant strides the past five years is evidenced by the fact
that the clearings are now running well over one million dollars per
week and are showing an average gain of 40 per cent over the
corresponding weeks of last year. The week ending June 5, 1909, showed
the remarkable increase of 130 per cent over the same week of 1908.

At the time of organization the banks of Cedar Rapids had a combined
capital of $630,000, surplus and undivided profits of $400,000, and
deposits of $7,800,000. At the present time they have a combined
capital of $900,000, surplus and undivided profits of over $800,000,
and deposits of $16,000,000. Since the organization of the clearing
house the deposits of country banks has increased from $2,000,000 to
more than $6,000,000, savings and time deposits from $4,200,000 to
$7,200,000, and individual demand deposits from $1,200,000 to
$2,200,000. Such a showing of growth and prosperity is an absolute
index of local conditions and speaks more eloquently than words of the
substantial manner in which this city is forging ahead in things
financial.

J. M. Dinwiddie served as president until December, 1906, being
succeeded by E. M. Scott, who served until December, 1908. Mr. Scott
was succeeded by J. W. Bowdish, who resigned in March of this year,
being succeeded by Kent C. Ferman. R. T. Forbes served as secretary and
manager until December, 1906. He was succeeded by Charles Fletcher,
Jr., who held the office until July, 1908, when he was succeeded by W.
J. Elliott. E. W. Virden, the first treasurer, was succeeded by John
Burianek, Jr., who served until December, 1907, when he was followed by
Louis Wokoun. The present officers are: President, Kent C. Ferman;
first vice-president, James E. Hamilton; second vice-president, John
Burianek, Jr.; treasurer, Louis Wokoun; secretary and manager, W. J.
Elliott.

The present membership comprises all the banks of the city, as follows:
Merchants National, Cedar Rapids National, Commercial National, Cedar
Rapids Savings, Security Savings, American Trust and Savings, People's
Savings, Iowa State Savings, Commercial Savings. The clearing house
association rooms are under the Merchants National Bank, and here
representatives from each bank in the city meet at eleven o'clock each
day to exchange checks, or "clear" the day's business.

The Commercial Savings Bank was organized December 13, 1905, with a
capital stock of $50,000. Its officers were C. H. Chandler, president;
W. C. LaTourette, vice-president; James L. Bever, Jr., cashier; with C.
H. Chandler, James L. Bever, Sr., W. C. LaTourette, H. Cushman, John B.
Bever, C. B. Robbins, E. J. Carey, A. Jeffrey, and C. Denecke,
directors. The bank has enjoyed due prosperity. There have been some
changes in its officers, C. H. Chandler continuing as its president to
this date. C. B. Robbins and E. J. Carey are the present
vice-presidents, and Ed. B. Zbanek, its cashier.

The Iowa State Savings Bank opened for business January 6, 1906, at the
corner of Tenth avenue and Third street. The capital stock was $50,000.
It is known as the "South End Bank," and was organized for the especial
accommodation of business men and individuals in the southern portion
of the city. The first officers were: A. Tomec, president; V. O. Hasek,
vice-president; and Joseph Lesinger, cashier. The present officers are:
V. O. Hasek, president; J. J. Cerveny, vice-president, and Joseph
Lesinger, cashier. Present capital stock $50,000; surplus, $5,000;
total resources, $525,000; deposits, $700,000.

The People's Savings Bank was organized March 10, 1900, with T.
McCarthy, president; H. E. Witwer and J. J. Powell, vice-presidents; E.
W. Virden, cashier; and T. McCarthy, H. E. Witwer, J. J. Powell, John
M. Redmond, Wm. King, George H. Boyson, A. H. Wolf, Theodore Stark, and
Fred H. Shaver, directors.

A. H. Wolf and George H. Boyson, having disposed of their interests in
1903, at the annual election held January, 1904, C. L. Miller and
George G. Grupe were elected in their places.

T. McCarthy, on account of his health, did not desire a re-election as
president, and E. W. Virden, having accepted a position in Louisiana,
caused a vacancy in the presidency and cashiership. At that meeting the
following officers were elected: H. E. Witwer, president, J. J. Powell
and Fred H. Shaver, vice-presidents; and John Burianek, Jr., cashier.
On January 9, 1906, at the annual meeting, Mr. Redmond being unable to
serve as a director, did not desire re-election and in his place John
Burianek, Jr., was chosen. On the death of J. J. Powell in 1908, Wm.
King was chosen one of the vice-presidents. The directors now are H. E.
Witwer, T. McCarthy, F. H. Shaver, G. G. Grupe, Wm. King, C. E. Tuttle,
E. S. Seeley, John Burianek, Jr.

Originally this bank had 83 stockholders, the number now being 53. It
has a surplus of $25,000, undivided profits of $10,000, and deposits of
nearly $900,000.

Early in 1911 the bank will occupy its new building on the corner of
First street and Third avenue west, one of the handsomest in the state.

The Cedar Rapids National Bank was incorporated February 28, 1887, and
succeeded to the business of G. F. Van Vechten, banker. The original
directors were A. T. Averill, Geo. B. Douglas, G. F. Van Vechten,
Joseph S. Cook, C. Magnus, J. M. Ristine, and C. B. Soutter. Changes in
the board of directors have occurred as follows:

In 1888 P. E. Hall succeeded J. M. Ristine. In 1891 Ralph Van Vechten
succeeded C. Magnus. In 1896 Mr. Magnus was reelected to succeed C. B.
Soutter. In 1899 Ed. H. Smith was elected to fill the vacancy caused by
the death of J. S. Cook. In 1906 P. E. Hall was succeeded by J. H.
Ingwersen. In 1906 C. Magnus retired from the board, and in January,
1907, J. M. Ristine was elected to fill the vacancy. In 1909 C. D. Van
Vechten was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the death of G. F.

The bank has a capital of $100,000, a surplus of $100,000, undivided

The Security Savings Bank was incorporated March 18, 1889, and opened
for business April 26, 1889.

The original stockholders numbered 87, of whom 22 have since died.

The original directors were G. F. Van Vechten, C. J. Ives, J. R.
Amidon, Walter D. Douglas, Chas. H. Clark, Jno. E. Murray, W. W.

succeeded C. J. Ives, who died that year, and in January, 1910, Emma M.
Van Vechten was elected to succeed her husband, G. F. Van Vechten,
whose death occurred the previous September.

President Van Vechten and Vice-President Ives served the bank
continuously from its organization to the date of their respective
deaths; Vice-President Amidon continuously since organization, and
President Scott the same--first as cashier, then vice-president, and
after Mr. Van Vechten's death, as president. On January 1, 1908, J. W.
Bowdish was engaged for one year to relieve Mr. Scott, during the
building period, and served as cashier throughout that year. Cashier
Frank Filip entered the employ of the bank in 1894, was promoted to
assistant cashier in 1904, and made cashier in 1909.

The original capital stock was $50,000, which was later increased to
$75,000, then to $100,000, and on March 24, 1908, to $150,000. The
present surplus is $100,000. Its total deposits are now about
$1,800,000, belonging to 5,000 depositors.

The bank first opened for business at 211 South Second street. In 1893
it erected on its own ground, 26x60 feet, on the corner of Second
avenue and Second street, a three-story brick bank building, containing
the first exclusive safety deposit vaults in the city. In 1902
additional ground was purchased and in 1907 the three-story brick
adjoining on the south was purchased and the bank removed to a
temporary office in this building, while its old home was replaced by
its present eight-story, steel frame, fire proof office building, where
its banking apartments are modern and complete.

The Bohemian-American State Bank was organized under state charter and
commenced business June 13, 1892, with a capital of $60,000, its
officers being W. F. Severa, president; S. L. Dows, vice-president; J.
W. Bowdish, cashier; V. A. Jung, assistant cashier. Among its
organizers were W. F. Severa, S. L. Dows, J. H. Douglas, F. Braun, Jos.
Woitishek, Jos. Renchin, E. E. Pinney, H. B. Soutter, T. C. Munger, C.
Butler Weeks, J. J. Powell, and Warren Harman. It had a successful
career and paid dividends from its commencement. It was consolidated
September 1, 1894, with the Bohemian-American Savings Bank, in order to
avail itself of the more liberal charter given by the state to savings
banks, the stockholders and depositors practically all remaining with
the new organization.

The Iowa Savings Bank was organized under state charter and commenced
business May 1, 1893, with a capital of $50,000. Its officers were
James H. Douglas, president; W. F. Severa and H. B. Soutter,

On September 1, 1893, the articles of incorporation were changed,
increasing the capital to $60,000, and changing the title to
Bohemian-American Savings Bank. At the same date the Bohemian-American
State Bank, desirous of the benefits of the more liberal charter
offered savings banks, arranged to consolidate its interest with the
Bohemian-American Savings Bank, which consolidation took effect
September 1, 1894.

The Bohemian-American Savings Bank enjoyed a prosperous growth,
notwithstanding the effect of the panic of 1893, probably as severe a
financial panic as at that time had ever been experienced. It paid
regular semi-annual dividends and continued prosperous until its
consolidation, March 28, 1898, with the Citizens National Bank and the
American Trust and Savings Bank, two newly organized banks, the
Citizens National Bank taking over the commercial department, and the
American Trust and Savings Bank absorbing the savings department.

account of death or disposition of stock have occurred as follows: In
1884 E. I. Foster succeeded F. J. Upton; in 1891 M. A. Higley succeeded
Mr. Foster; in 1892, at the death of F. C. Hormel, J. M. Dinwiddie

Bever, and E. R. Moore succeeded Geo. W. Bever. President John T.
Hamilton, Vice-President Chas. B. Soutter, and Cashier J. M. Dinwiddie
have served continuously since the organization of the bank.

The original capital stock of the bank, paid in cash, was $50,000,
which has been twice increased--the first time to $75,000, and then to
$100,000. The present surplus of the bank is $65,000, and the deposits
over $1,850,000.

The contract for the bank's six-story, fire proof building, the first
six-story structure in the city, located at the corner of Third avenue
and Third street, was let May 30, 1895, and the building was occupied
in May, 1896. In 1909-10 an addition was erected, so that the building
is now 90x140 feet.

Its present officers are John T. Hamilton, president; Chas. B. Soutter,
vice-president; Robert Palmer, vice-president; J. M. Dinwiddie,
cashier; and W. J. Elliott, assistant cashier. Its directors are: John

Henderson, P. C. Frick, W. W. Higley, J. C. Broeksmit, A. B. George, S.
L. Dows. Its first president was R. D. Stephens. John W. Henderson was
chosen vice-president, and Charles E. Putnam, cashier.

Mr. Stephens died in April, 1883, and was succeeded by M. A. Higley as
president. In the spring of 1899 John T. Hamilton purchased the
Stephens and other interests in the bank, and on June 5, 1899,
succeeded Redmond Stephens as director. On July 1, 1889, M. A. Higley
tendered his resignation as president, after more than sixteen years'
service in that position, John T. Hamilton being chosen president,
which office he still holds.

Chas. E. Putnam remained as cashier of the bank from the organization
to January 14, 1905, when he resigned and was succeeded by James E.
Hamilton, who had been assistant cashier since January 28, 1901. On the
consolidation of the Merchants National and the Citizens National, May
18, 1908, James E. Hamilton was made vice-president, and John S.
Broeksmit, who had been cashier of the Citizens National, was made
cashier of the new and consolidated Merchants National.

The original capital stock of the Merchants National was $100,000. The
present capitalization is $200,000; surplus, $200,000; deposits of
nearly $5,000,000.

From the time of its organization in 1881 until the consolidation with
the Citizens National in May, 1908, more than twenty-seven years, the
Merchants National occupied the room in the Ely block at the corner of
Second avenue and Third street. The bank is now occupying elegant
quarters in the remodeled Cedar Rapids Savings Bank building. The
present officers are John T. Hamilton, president; P. C. Frick,
vice-president; James E. Hamilton, vice-president; John S. Broeksmit,

first officers were George W. Bever, president; E. E. Pinney and W. F.
Severa, vice-presidents; R. T. Forbes, cashier. Its first board of
directors consisted of E. E. Pinney, J. L. Bever, J. B. Bever, W. F.
Severa, Jas. H. Douglas, Geo. W. Bever, F. Braun, T. C. Munger, and
Joseph Renchin. The object of its organization was to establish and
conduct a strictly savings business. It took over at the date of its
commencement the savings department of the Bohemian-American Savings
Bank, and its total deposits on April 9, 1898, were $175,338.23, its
location then being at the corner of First street and Second avenue.

On February 22, 1899, it moved into the Masonic Temple at the corner of
First street and First avenue, which location it still occupies. In
1901 the capital was increased from $50,000 to $80,000. This was
rendered necessary owing to increased deposits, in order to comply with
the then existing statutes governing the relative allowable amounts of
deposits to capital stock.

On January 1, 1908, the controlling interest in the bank passed into
the hands of Ernest R. Moore, Louis Wokoun, and others of their
associates who were the dominant factors in the Fidelity Trust &
Savings Bank, of this city. They arranged and carried out the
consolidation of the two institutions. The officers then elected and
board of directors named continue until this time. The present officers
are Ernest R. Moore, president; W. F. Severa, S. G. Armstrong, and Otto

S. S. Sweet, E. E. Clark, Ralph Van Vechten, N. M. Hubbard, Jr., John
A. Reed, S. G. Armstrong, and W. L. Crissman.

Its board elected L. M. Rupert as secretary and the officers as first
selected remained the same during the corporation's continuance under
the name of the Cedar Rapids Loan & Trust Company. The company was
located at the northwest corner of First street and Second avenue and
was conducted as a trust company until June 1, 1904, when a majority of
the capital stock passed into the hands of Ernest R. Moore and Louis
Wokoun and their associates. In order to bring the institution under
the operation of the general savings bank laws of the state and to
permit it to transact a general banking business the articles of
incorporation were amended to change the name to The Fidelity Trust &
Savings Bank while at the same time the office of the bank was changed
to 116 South Second street, a location much nearer the business center
of the city. Under the reorganization the stockholders selected the
following officers and directors: W. W. Hamilton, president; Ernest R.
Moore, first vice-president; W. G. Dows, second vice-president; Louis

CHAPTER XLII

_Roster of County Officers_


Linn county was organized in 1838 and the first election for county
officers was held August, 1839. The legislative board of the county, or
what corresponds to our present board of supervisors, was composed of
three members called a board of commissioners. The following persons
served on the board of commissioners:

Samuel C. Stewart, Peter McRoberts, Luman M. Strong, 1839.
E. T. Lewis, B. McGonigle, S. C. Stewart, 1842.
E. T. Lewis, Oliver Day, B. McGonigle, 1843.
Oliver Day, E. T. Lewis, W. B. Davis, 1844.
W. B. Davis, Andrew Safely, 1846.
Andrew Safely, Benjamin Waterhouse, Samuel Hendrickson, 1847.
S. Hendrickson, Andrew Safely, Johnson Hill, 1850.
A. Safely, Johnson Hill, Wm. A. Thomas, 1851.

The above system continued until the first code was enacted in 1851
which abolished the board of commissioners and provided for the
election of one officer to be called "county judge" who performed the
duties of our present board of supervisors and in addition was probate
judge and presided over what was called a "county court." The old
election books now preserved in the county auditor's office show the
following persons to have been elected to this office:

Norman W. Isbell, elected August, 1851.
James M. Berry, elected August, 1854.
Daniel Lothian, elected August, 1857, three terms.
Johnston Elliott, elected October, 1863, two terms.
A. B. Dumont, elected October, 1867, one term.

Isbell resigned June 12, 1854, and Joseph B. Young, prosecuting
attorney, acted as county judge until the next election when James M.
Berry was elected to fill the vacancy.

The legislative duties of the county judge were vested by the Eighth
General Assembly in a board of supervisors consisting of one member
from each township or two in those townships having over 4,000
inhabitants. The first board sat January 7, 1861. The clerk of the
district court was ex-officio clerk of the board of supervisors. The
Twelfth General Assembly abolished the office of county judge
altogether and vesting the judicial duties in the district court
created the office of county auditor to assume the ones not already
vested in the supervisors and clerk of the district court. The first
auditor's term began the first Monday of January, 1869.

days, carried a musket which he leaned up in the corner of the door and
door frame. The opening of the door threw the gun on the floor, and it
was discharged, wounding Mr. Bottorf in the heel. The wound was not
considered serious but blood poisoning set in and death resulted.

CHAPTER XLIII

_History of Marion, the County Seat_

BY HON. JAMES E. BROMWELL


Marion, most fittingly called the "City Beautiful," or the "Grove
City," was laid out in 1839 on a semi-circular plateau of prairie that
lay within a timbered crescent bordering and following the course of
Indian creek on the west, and opening into a vast extent of prairie on
the east, to which it lay joined like a protected harbor of the sea.
Before it was laid out in the spring of 1839, it was located by a
special board of commissioners appointed by the territorial legislature
of Iowa in 1838, as the county seat of Linn county, and was named in
honor of General Francis Marion.

David A. Woodbridge, who was appointed to superintend the work, and
Ross McCloud, the first county surveyor, proceeded to lay out the town,
and on December 2, 1839, assisted by Hosea W. Gray and A. J. McKean as
chain carriers, Elisha Kemp stake driver, and Ira Wilson flagman, and
under the direction of David A. Woodbridge, agent, the town of Marion
was platted on the west half of the northwest quarter of section six,
township eighty-three, range six, and the east half of the northeast
quarter of section one, township eighty-three, range seven.

The town consisted of fifty-six blocks, 250 feet square. The lots were
60 by 120 feet, and the alleys ten feet wide. The four streets that
enclose the public square were laid out eighty feet wide, all other
streets sixty feet wide. The lots on which the court house and other
county buildings now stand, were then reserved for public use, as was
the park, consisting of the block directly north of that on which the
county buildings now stand, and block fifty-six, the southwest block of
the plat, was reserved for a public cemetery.

Isbell's Grove, now known as Irish Hill, lay to the southeast of the
town plat like a beautiful emerald island cut off from the body of
timber lying south of it by a strip of prairie, where, in 1838, William
K. Farnsworth had entered a claim. He was the first actual town
settler, although James Preston and Prior Scott had entered a large
tract of land east of Isbell's Grove about the same time, and a part of
which lay open until the eighties, and was known as Scott's Prairie.

Soon after the town was located, Luman M. Strong and James W. Bassitt
located northwest of the town; Rufus H. Lucore, west; John C. Berry and
Hosea W. Gray, north; James W. Willis, northeast: George W. Gray,
south; John Margrave, northwest; and Aaron Moriarity, James and
Henderson Smith on the land now owned by Emmett Kemp; James Blackman,
adjoining on the northeast; Samuel Ross, his mother and several
brothers, adjoining the Willis place, later known as the E. A. Vaughn
farm.

[Illustration: VIEW OF MARION, 1868]

Henry Thompson erected a mill three miles south on Indian creek. The
timber southwest and west was taken up in small parcels; and Ephraim P.
Lewis, one of the second board of county commissioners, and A. B. Mason
settled between Marion and Cedar Rapids and were the first settlers in
that direction. All of these came to Iowa in 1839; and in the fall of
that year the Brodies and Leveriches settled two miles northwest of
town. A little later Norris Cone settled southeast towards Mount
Vernon, and Norman, George, and John Elihu Ives, four miles east; and a
large part of the Ives land is now owned by two sons of Elihu Ives,
viz: John and Julius Ives. W. L. Winter and wife settled on Dry
creek, northwest of Marion, in 1842; and the wife, Clarissa D.
Winter, eighty-eight years of age in March, 1910, with her mind
unimpaired, and intellect grown seemingly brighter with the years, is
living with her daughter, Mrs. R. Lee Taylor, in Marion.

The first house built in Marion, although then without the town plat,
was that of Luman M. Strong, erected in 1839. It was also the first
tavern. It stood on the Center Point road, now known as Central avenue,
and occupied the site where Alvin M. Goldsberry built his home, which
is now owned by J. B. Michel. The second house was built the same year
by Henry Thompson and David A. Woodbridge, also outside the town plat,
and on the site now occupied by the residence known for years as the H.
P. Elliott home, on Twelfth street, just north of the Odd Fellows
building. These men also built the first store, a log shanty, near
where Charles A. Patten's residence now stands on north Eleventh
street; and were licensed by the commissioners as follows: "Ordered,
that Woodbridge and Thompson be allowed a license to vend and retail
foreign merchandise at their store in Marion, for one year from the 9th
day of October, 1839." In 1840 Addison Daniels came to Marion on
horseback from Iowa City, seeking a business location, although there
was not a house nor tree within the city limits, just a sea of tall,
waving, wild grass with cow-paths running here and there. But he
contracted with Hosea W. Gray for the erection of a store building
20x22 feet in size, and went to Muscatine by horse and thence to St.
Louis by boat, where he purchased a stock of goods and returned to
Marion. It took him about six months to make the trip, and when he
returned he found his store room ready, and three residences in the
town proper, viz: that of George Greene, afterwards judge of the
supreme court of Iowa, capitalist, and later a prominent citizen of
Cedar Rapids, on Main street west of Market street on the lot later
occupied by the residence of Joseph Mentzer in the rear of C. F.
Reichert's grocery store; that of Joseph W. Bigger, later a prominent
farmer southeast of Marion, where Dr. Bardwell lived so many years, and
now occupied by Eliza Bardwell: and that of L. D. Phillips, built by
Joseph W. Bigger, assisted by James E. Bromwell, as a hotel and known
for many years as the American House, later as the Newhall, on the site
now occupied by Ed. Sigfred's clothing store.

The first store of Marion, in the city proper, was that of Addison
Daniels, who continued in business for nearly half a century with
marked success. It stood on the site now occupied by the Home Bakery of
Mrs. Smith, on Tenth street. Mr. Daniels was Marion's first postmaster,
a man of public spirit, sterling integrity, and unimpeachable
character. He died June 18, 1883.

In the spring of 1840, O. S. Hall, a pioneer of marked christian
character, built a one and a half story frame building just north of
the first store of Mr. Daniels, where he opened a hotel known as the
Iowa House. He also served one term as county recorder in 1843. He died
in 1846, but the hotel was continued by his widow and son, O. S. Hall,
Jr., still living in Marion, until 1871, but in later years in the
large brick building in the same block at the corner of Tenth street
and Eighth avenue. In the same spring the first jail of the county was
built, a log structure, on lot two, block thirty-six, and where the
Catholic church now stands, at a cost of $635.00. It was built by
William Abbe and Asher Edgerton. William Abbe had removed to Marion
from his claim near Mount Vernon on Abbe creek, which was named for
him, and where the commissioners met to locate the county seat, and
which was also one of the first polling places of the county. The first
court house was built on the northeast corner of the block occupied by
the present county buildings. Here the first school was held in Marion.
The building was bought in 1845 for use as a Methodist church. It was
later occupied for many years by Leonard Stowe for a bakery and
grocery, and has recently been remodeled for residence flats. However,
the county records show that the Methodists had made provision for a
church building several years before, but probably by reason of the
scarcity of money in those days, had been unable to build such an
edifice as was required by a resolution of the county commissioners at
their April term, 1842, which read as follows: "Ordered by the Board
that the Trustees of the Methodist Episcopal church of the Town of
Marion be allowed and they are hereby authorized to purchase of the
county agent lots number three and four in block number thirty-seven on
condition that they pay said agent the sum of ten dollars and erect on
said lots a good and substantial church building worth at least $1,500
within two years; and the said agent is hereby empowered to execute the
above sale." This description of the lots was doubtless wrong, for
these were the lots where A. J. McKean built his home, where he lived
until his decease. The lots intended, and where the first Methodist
church was built, were lots one and two in block twenty-seven. The
present court house was built in 1841 by George W. Gray, contractor.

In the spring of 1840 Hiram Beales built and operated a saw mill, if
not the first, one of the first in the county, on Indian creek west of
the town and on the west side of Indian creek, opposite the site of the
present Howler Mill. In 1841 Richard Thomas became a partner in this
mill and mill stones were introduced for grinding grain. The first
upper mill stone used in this mill has an interesting history. Ambrose
Harland, once sheriff of Linn county, and who first lived at the place
known later as the "Old Stone Barn," on the old road between Marion and
Cedar Rapids, was a stone mason and built the first brick residence in
Marion in 1842 for William H. Woodbridge. This house stood in the
street, where now the Methodist parsonage stands, and was for years
known as the Berry house. In 1884 Samuel Daniels, who settled in Marion
after the war and was Linn county's third auditor, bought this Berry
house, and by reason of it occupying a part of the street and thus
disfiguring the block of which Mr. Daniels owned the greater part, tore
it down. As one of the corner stones of this house, Mr. Daniels found
this first upper mill stone of the Beales and Thomas mill, which had in
1842 been replaced by a larger one, and has preserved it as a relic of
early days.

Richard Thomas, commonly known as "Uncle Dick," came to Marion in 1840,
and was a remarkable character. His farm embraced what is now known as
"Orchard Heights," one of the most beautiful additions of Marion. He
was of southern birth, quaint, plain-spoken, energetic, and died in
1893 at the age of 111 years. His widow and daughter, Mary English,
also a widow, occupy a beautiful home in "Orchard Heights" near the
original building site of the old farm.

In 1841 the first school house was built in Marion by subscription, and
on the site now occupied by the C. R. Fairfield Lumber Company's
office. It stood alone in the open prairie, and was surrounded by wild
grass fully five feet high. Mr. Higby was Marion's first school master.
It was in this building that Rev. Mr. Emerson organized the first
Methodist society.

In 1838 the territorial legislature appointed Richard Knott, Lyman
Dillon, and Benjamin Nye commissioners to locate the "seat of justice"
in Linn county, and on the first Monday in March, 1839, two of said
commissioners, Richard Knott and Benjamin Nye, met at the house of
William Abbe, on Abbe's creek, and chose the site of the town of Marion
as the proper location for the county seat.

In August, 1839, three commissioners were elected to act as fiscal
agents of the county. The polling place was Westport, near the present
site of Bertram, and Samuel C. Stewart, Peter McRoberts, and Luman M.
Strong were elected. This commission was invested with about the same
powers as are now exercised by the board of supervisors of the county.
They held their first meeting in Marion on September 9, 1839. H. W.
Gray, the first appointed and first elected sheriff of Linn county,
proclaimed the board in session. Its first official act was the
appointment of John C. Berry, clerk. It next named the county seat,
Marion. It next appointed A. J. McKean and William H. Smith
constables. At its October session, 1839, it divided the county into
three election precincts, viz: one at William Abbe's, on Abbe creek,
known as the Sugar Grove precinct; one at Marion, known as the Marion
precinct; and one at Michael Green's, known as Green's Grove precinct.
The first election judges of Marion were James W. Bassitt, Henry
Thompson, and Rufus H. Lucore. At this session James W. Willis was
allowed $7.75 for five days' work making town stakes and hauling same,
"three loads." The first road laid out was as follows, and ordered
January 6, 1840: "Beginning at the county line west of Lathrup
Olmsted's farm; thence on the nearest and best ground to the town of
Marion; thence to the rapids of Cedar river; thence to the county line
on a direction to Iowa City, the seat of the Territorial government."

We quote one other entry of the county commissioners made at the
January term, 1840: "Ordered by the Board that James W. Willis be and
is hereby allowed the privilege of cutting a sufficient amount of
timber off from the quarter section of land on which the town of Marion
is located to finish a certain frame for which he has already got a
part; provided, however, that he shall not cut any timber that is not
included in the streets of said town. Said privilege is granted in
consideration of house rent and fuel for the January term of this
board. 1840." A very significant entry was made by this board of
commissioners at its April term, 1840, in which Luman M. Strong, one of
the commissioners, was granted a license to keep a grocery and "vend
spiritous liquors at retail for one year at his house near Marion by
paying into the county treasury the sum of $50.00." In a later record,
and the only one referring to the claimant as a public officer, R. P.
Lowe, district attorney for 1840, is allowed $75.00.

The county judge plan succeeded the commissioner system of government
in 1851, and Norman W. Isbell was the first judge, and was elected in
1851. He was succeeded in turn by J. M. Berry, Daniel Lothian, Johnston
Elliott, and A. B. Dumont. The supervisor system, one from each
township of the county, by order of the legislature, supplanted the
county judge in 1861; and Marion was represented on this first board by
A. J. Twogood. In 1871 the present system of county government by a
board of three supervisors was adopted. County Judge J. M. Berry, in
1855, in his official capacity, contracted for the erection of the
present jail and fire proof building where the county offices are now
located, and this brought on the court house fight of 1855, when the
issues were fairly joined in the contest for election to the county
judgeship between J. M. Berry, representing Marion, and Rev. Elias
Skinner, representing Cedar Rapids. Berry won by a handsome majority.

Hosea W. Gray, a man of marked ability and prominent in the early
history of Marion, was elected the first sheriff of Linn county. At the
same election, to wit: in August, 1839, Thomas W. Campbell was elected
county treasurer; Socrates H. Tryon, who was also Marion's first
physician, county clerk; and G. H. Tryon, was either elected or
appointed the first county recorder. Although it is well authenticated
that Richard Osborn and Sarah Haines were married in Linn county in
1839, the first marriage in Marion and the second license of record in
the county is that of James E. Bromwell and Catherine Gray, date August
26, 1841. This saintly pioneer died in Marion May 5, 1900, after more
than sixty years continuous residence in Marion and on his farm, one
and a half miles east of the town, honored and loved by all. The same
year John Hunter was married to Hannah Barbary Hines, and Charles Rowe
to Phebe Putnam, and Ans Safely to Margaret Hunter, and Samuel Ross to
Mary Vaughn, and John Mann to Mary Mann, and Julius Allen Peet to
Esther Ann Crowe, and Aaron Moriarity to Hannah Ross, and Joseph Crane
to Agnes Bogard.

Hosea W. Gray, who in the Civil war was captain of Company A, Sixth
Iowa Infantry, and Linn county's first sheriff, took the first census
of Linn county in 1840, which showed a population of 1,373. The vote at
the first election in 1839 showed thirty-two ballots cast. October 28,
1840, Peter Garrow, born in Scotland, renounced allegiance to Queen
Victoria and declared his intention to become of citizen of the United
States. The first divorce case was filed May 26, 1842, and entitled
Dyer Usher vs. Mary Ann Usher. At the September term, 1843, it was
ordered dismissed. The first divorce granted in Linn county was at the
March term, 1844, of the district court, when Parthena E. Hewitt
obtained a decree of divorce from her husband, Oliver Hewitt. The title
of the first case filed in the district court of Linn county is Richard
Thomas vs. O. S. Hall, being an appeal case brought for trespass. After
several continuances it was dismissed. George Greene, Marion's first
lawyer, was counsel for the plaintiff. William G. Thompson was the
first prosecuting attorney for what was called the second circuit,
consisting of the counties of Cedar, Jones, and Linn, and of the eighth
judicial district after the establishment of the circuit court, in
1868. The first murder committed in Linn county occurred in Marion
March 20, 1847, when James Reed--who then and for many years after
occupied the farm later known as the Bachman farm, on the old road
about half way between Marion and Cedar Rapids, and whose house was
destroyed by the tornado of 1860--struck Nathaniel Carnagy with a sled
stake, fracturing his skull, from which injuries he died two weeks
later. Reed was indicted but found not guilty by a jury.

The tornado of 1860, which passed through Linn county on Sunday, June
3, started about six miles west of Marion. It struck the southwest part
of the town but the only damage done was to a brick smoke house
standing west of the house then occupied by Willard Harlan, now the
home of J. Q. A. Dutton, the last house on the street car line east of
Indian creek. The first deed recorded was for lots five and six, block
eleven, Marion, and was executed by the county commissioners April 4,
1843, to Horace Metcalf. The second deed is to Addison Daniels. The
consideration is nine dollars. It bears the same date and is for lots
one and two, block fourteen, the present Clogston home, lot seven,
block twelve, where the T. J. Davis building on Tenth street now
stands, and lot eight, block thirteen, on a part of which the First
National Bank now stands. The selection of these lots is good evidence
of the business ability of Mr. Daniels in those early days.

The plats of the towns of Marion and Cedar Rapids were recorded on the
same day, to wit: April 3, 1843, "O. S. Hall, Recorder." In volume 216
on page 48, Recorder's office, is a record showing the organization of
the Presbyterian society, on November 11, 1839. William Vaughn is named
as one of the elders.

A. J. McKean, who came to Linn county in 1839, helped lay out the town
of Marion, was the first constable of Linn county, and the first
assessor for the whole county, by appointment in 1840. He served as
clerk of the courts from 1854 to 1872, and was one of Marion's most
prominent citizens for over half a century. His brother, Thomas J.
McKean, was the first mayor of the town of Marion which was
incorporated in 1865. He was elected sheriff of the county in 1859,
serving until the spring of 1861, when he resigned to enter the
government army service, having already served in the Florida and
Mexican wars, and November 21, 1861, was appointed brigadier-general,
and after a brilliant service in the Civil war was honorably discharged
in 1865, as brevet major general. On September 5, 1848, he was married
to Sarah T. Gray, who still survives him, is a resident of Marion, and
still bright and active at the age of ninety years.

One of the most prominent men in the early history of Marion, and we
might add of the county, was Samuel W. Durham. A courtly gentleman of
the old school, honored and respected by every one who knew him, he
died at his home in Marion, May 2, 1909, at the ripe old age of
ninety-two years. He was sheriff of Linn county from 1846-1848, county
surveyor in 1841, serving one term, in 1851 serving one term, in 1871
serving two terms, and in 1889 serving two terms. He was also a member
of the first constitutional convention of Iowa, which convened at Iowa
City October 7, 1844.

[Illustration: JAMES E. BROMWELL, SR.]

George Greene, Marion's first lawyer, and who built one of its first
three residences, was the first member of the General Assembly from
Linn county. He also served in the council, now called the state
senate, of the third legislative assembly of Iowa, which convened at
Burlington November 2, 1840, representing Cedar, Jones, and Linn
counties. He also served in the fourth assembly, which convened at Iowa
City December 6, 1841.

The first court was held in Marion October 26, 1840, and the following
record was made: "Minutes of the District Court of Iowa Territory,
within and for the county of Linn:

     "Iowa Territory  }
                      }
     Linn County      }

     "Pursuant to an act of the Legislature of the Territory of
     Iowa, approved July, 1840, the District Court of the United
     States, and also for the Territory of Iowa, met at Marion,
     in said county, on Monday the 26th day of October, 1840.
     Present: Hon. Joseph Williams, Judge of the Second Judicial
     District for the Territory; W. G. Woodward, Esq., District
     Attorney of the United States for the District of Iowa; R.

Ira G. Fairbanks was the first superintendent of county schools.

In the first constitutional convention which was held at Iowa City
October 7, 1844, and whose work was rejected by the people at the polls
August 4, 1845, Linn county was represented by Thomas J. McKean, Samuel
W. Durham, and Luman M. Strong. At the second one, held at Iowa City
May 4, 1846, and whose work was endorsed by a small majority at the
election held August 3, 1846, Socrates H. Tryon represented Linn and
Benton counties.

The first estate ministered upon in Linn county was that of James
Travis, who died in December, 1839. James Doty was appointed
administrator February 15, 1840. His bond was for $200. His bondsmen
were Jacob Leabo and John Stambaugh. Israel Mitchell, who had been
appointed by Governor Lucas, in 1839, was the judge of probate. It was
this same Judge Mitchell who located the first town in Linn county,
viz: that of Westport, near the present site of Bertram, and who was
the orator of the day at the first Fourth of July celebration in Linn
county, held at Westport in 1839.

The second estate appearing of record was that of William Marion, who
died July 4, 1840, and of which William Abbe was appointed
administrator in 1841.

The third was the estate of Martin Martindale, who died in February of
1841, and of whose estate William Garrison was appointed administrator.

The following is the record of the first coffin made in Linn county:
"Be it remembered that on the 21st day of June, A. D. 1841, James E.
Bromwell filed his account in the Court of Probate against the estate
of Martin Martindale, deceased, in the words and figures, to wit:

                      "To J. E. Bromwell, Dr.
     "To one white walnut coffin,     $12.00"

Marion was the home for years of three Mexican war veterans, who were
also veterans of the Civil war, viz: Thomas J. McKean, G. A. Gray, both
deceased, and Samuel B. Thompson, now past ninety years of age and
living with his daughter, Mrs. Nellie Schimmerhorn, of Kansas City.

Marion was incorporated in 1865. Its first mayor was General Thomas J.
McKean. The other officers were: recorder, G. A. Gray; trustees, D. H.
McDanel, who died in Chicago and whose widow is now living in Cedar
Rapids; S. W. Rathbun, still living in Marion and editor and proprietor
of the Marion _Register_, which was established as the _Prairie Star_
in 1852 by A. Hoyt; G. F. Woods, who died in Marion some years ago; O.
C. Wyman, now a merchant prince of Minneapolis; and Dr. N. W. Owen, who
died in 1880.

The Marion fire department was organized in 1874 and consisted of the
Phoenix engine company and the J. C. Davis hook and ladder company. D.
P. Thurber was elected the first foreman of the Phoenix company, and A.
J. Keyes of the hook and ladder company. The first engine house was the
old Baptist church which stood on the site of the present C., M. & St.
P. depot. Such was the beginning of the later noted Marion Volunteer
Fire Department, with its matchless Mentzer Hose Company, which as a
drill corps, under the captaincy of James E. Bromwell, for twenty
years, in the state of Iowa and elsewhere, challenged all military and
civic companies, and met all challengers in competitive contests,
winning over fifty first prizes, cups, and purses, acting as special
escort to Governor Cummins at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904, and
winning over all contestants at the National Firemen's Tournament of
the Trans-Mississippi Exposition, held at Omaha in 1898, and retiring
without a single defeat as a drill corps after its first three years,
although as a fire company it is still active and efficient and the
possessor of a beautiful home of its own on Seventh avenue in Marion,
the lower story being used as a hose house and armory, and the upper
story for reception and club rooms.

In 1864 the Dubuque and Southwestern Railroad, running from Farley to
Cedar Rapids, was built into Marion, and in 1872 the Sabula, Ackley &
Dakota Railroad--now the C., M. &. St. P.--connected Marion with
Chicago. Here it terminated until it was extended west to Council
Bluffs in 1880, and south to Kansas City in 1882.

Marion was especially favored in its early history, as it is today, by
competent and popular physicians. Of these there were three, probably
best known, who are worthy of mention, viz: Drs. Thos. S. Bardwell,
Henry M. Ristine, and N. W. Owen. Dr. Thomas S. Bardwell came to
Marion with his father, Dr. Leonard Bardwell, in 1841. He studied
medicine with his father, and after attending lectures in St. Louis
began practice in Marion in 1850. He was a natural doctor, bringing
into his practice not only a knowledge of medicine but that intuition
and instinctive comprehension of the law of cause and effect as applied
to the human system which mark the genius in materia medica and
surgery. He was a great hearted man, kind, generous, charitable, a
devoted son and brother, a loyal friend and citizen. He died in Marion
in 1895.

Henry M. Ristine came to Marion in 1842. He, too, was a master in the
ministry of relief to human suffering. His genial presence and cheerful
and encouraging words added much to the magic of his medicine. His
friends were legion. He was welcomed to the homes where he was called
as a physician as a beloved brother, and was always a comfort and a
blessing in the sick room. In the early days and to the second
generation his name was a household word throughout Linn county. He
moved to Cedar Rapids in 1875, where, crowned with success and honors
in his chosen calling, he died in 1897.

Norman W. Owen came to Marion in 1856. He continued the study of
medicine, which he had begun in the east, under Dr. Henry M. Ristine,
and graduated from Rush Medical College in 1862. He at once entered
into a partnership with Dr. Ristine, and during his absence in the
Civil war, he drove almost night and day, attending the large practice
which he was left alone to care for. He was a most skilful and
successful physician. He united with a wide knowledge of diseases and
their remedies, the tenderness and skill of the trained nurse. An
earnest student, of analytical yet comprehensive mind, he became a
pioneer in the discovery of new remedies for human ailments, and while
he formulated and compounded many preparations now of common use, his
greatest achievement was the discovery and composition of Owen and
Chamberlain's--now Chamberlain's--Colic, Cholera, and Diarrhoea Remedy,
a world-wide panacea, of which Dr. Owen was the sole and undisputed
originator. This alone places him among the "immortals" in the realm of
medicine. He died in Marion in 1880.

Among the early great financiers of Marion--and we might say of Iowa
and the west--was Redmond D. Stephens. He came to Marion in 1855. He
was a lawyer, teacher, and scholar, as well as a banker. He obtained
the third charter ever issued for a national bank in Iowa, and
instituted the First National Bank of Marion in 1863. He was one of the
county supervisors in 1867, and was elected to the state legislature in
1879. He organized the Merchants National Bank of Cedar Rapids in 1881,
of which, as well as of the First National Bank of Marion, he was
president when he died in Cedar Rapids in 1883, where he then resided.
His rare acumen, keen perception, unerring judgment, and almost
prophetic endowment, mastered every business enterprise he undertook
and won for him the merited distinction with which success ever crowns
the union of genius and studiousness, of being enthroned, honored, and
acknowledged as king in the chosen realm of his life work.

No early history of Marion would be complete without mention of that
brilliant coterie which illumined Linn county's seat of justice and as
pillars and ornaments of the law established and adorned the now famous
bar of Linn county. Nothing in later years has compared with the
gladiatorial contests of the early years when true forensic oratory,
keenest wit, and brilliant satire made forever famous the legal arena
within the old court house at Marion. What memories and achievements
cluster about the names of Corbett, Hubbard, Preston, Isbell, Thompson,
Young and Smyth.

Nathaniel M. Hubbard, the greatest legal general of his time, who
served one year as judge of the eighth district in 1865, was keen,
alert, tactful, resourceful, and tireless. He won marked distinction in
his profession, and died in Cedar Rapids a few years ago, as chief
counsel for the Chicago & Northwestern Railway.

Norman W. Isbell, student, scholar, interpreter of the law, judge of
the eighth district in 1862, died in the prime of life, a great mind in
a frail body.

J. B. Young, brilliant, scholarly, eloquent, came to Marion in 1853;
was elected prosecuting attorney for Linn county in 1854. He served in
the state legislature in 1861, in the state senate in 1863, and was
re-elected in 1866. He was army paymaster, with the rank of major,
during the Civil war, elector-at-large in 1868, and United States
pension agent in 1869. Impetuous, fiery, generous, of marked aptness
and ability, he honored and adorned his chosen profession.

William Smyth came to Iowa in 1843 and to Marion in 1846--the year he
was admitted to the bar. He was elected prosecuting attorney for the
county in 1847, appointed judge of the fourth district in 1853, elected
in 1854, and re-elected in 1856, but resigned in 1857, and with his
brother, Robert Smyth, and A. J. Twogood established the first bank in
Linn county, later known as the Twogood and Elliott bank of Marion. In
1858 he was chairman of the committee of three to revise and codify the
laws of the state of Iowa, and the criminal code of 1860 is largely his
work. In 1862 he was commissioned colonel of the Thirty-first Iowa
Volunteer Infantry, serving until 1864. He then formed a law
partnership with J. B. Young, and was actively engaged in the practice
until 1868, when he was elected to congress. He was renominated in
1870, but on September 30, 1870, before the election, died at his
beautiful suburban home adjoining the city of Marion, now owned by the
Sisters of Mercy, and known as St. Joseph's Academy. A man of sound
judgment, a lawyer of merit, a judge of ability, a statesman of
fidelity and purity, he yet stood pre-eminently before all as a man of
integrity, honor, and character, the true and highest type of the
Christian gentleman.

I shall now mention as the last, the two greatest lawyers of the early
days of Marion, judging from their practice, marked success, and
general recognition, viz: Isaac M. Preston, and William G. Thompson.

Isaac M. Preston came to Marion in 1842. He was elected probate judge
of Linn county in 1842, appointed district attorney for the eighteenth
judicial district of Iowa in 1845, again elected probate judge in 1847,
the same year was appointed United States district attorney for Iowa by
President Polk, was elected to the state legislature in 1848, and
elected the first state senator in 1852 for Linn, Benton, and Tama
counties. He moved to Cedar Rapids in 1878, where he died in 1880. He
was possessed of a strong mind, his reasoning was logical, and his
analysis keen. He aspired to greatness in his profession above all
else. He was pronounced by competent judges the greatest criminal
lawyer of Iowa in his day. Rugged, determined, persistent, tireless,
profound, thoroughly versed in the common law, of broad conception, a
close student and able judge of human nature, deliberate, careful,
prudent; in speech plain, masterful, convincing; he having reached a
conclusion in law or taken a position legally or morally, was seldom if
ever compelled to compromise or retreat.

William G. Thompson came to Marion in 1853 and first began the practice
of law with I. M. Preston. He was prosecuting attorney in 1854, editor
of the Marion _Register_ (which he bought to insure a republican paper
for Linn county) in 1855 and 1856, state senator in 1856 and 1858,
major of the Twentieth Iowa Volunteer Infantry, serving until 1864,
elector-at-large on the republican ticket in 1864, district attorney of
the eighth judicial district from 1867 to 1874, chief justice of Idaho
in 1878, elected to congress in 1879, and refused to accept a
renomination. In 1884, to save the republican legislative ticket, he
was nominated for the state legislature and elected. He was appointed
judge of the eighteenth district in 1894, and was elected in the fall
of the same year, re-elected in 1898 and 1902. He is now living in
retirement with his son. J. M. Thompson, at his beautiful home, "The
Elms," on the boulevard between Marion and Cedar Rapids. Major Thompson
was naturally possessed of the elements of true greatness, viz:
simplicity, sympathy, generosity, and charity. While he was in truth
the "poor man's friend," he was more truly everybody's friend. His was
a brilliant mind, a tender heart, an eloquent yet poignant tongue. Of
quick intuition, forceful expression, and impassioned oratory, he
carried juries with the force of the mountain torrent. His great tender
heart was the repository of anybody's troubles or sorrows or legal
difficulties "without money and without price," if needs be. As a
lawyer he was comprehensive, ingenious, and aggressive. As a judge,
merciful, conscientious, and just. The equitable appealed to him in
every branch of the law. No truer friend, no more loyal partisan, no
more zealous advocate, ever stood rock bound, unchangeable, and
immovable as William G. Thompson always stood without malice or
offense. Devoted to his home, his wife, and only son, cheerful, sunny,
optimistic, unerring in his measurement of men and motives, charitable
and forgiving beyond belief, honored and honorable, commonplace and
companionable, always kind and considerate and helpful, great hearted,
of noble soul, and of almost divine compassion, Judge William G.
Thompson has already erected his monument of Christlike deeds, and his
sepulchre will be the inner shrines of the hearts of all who knew him.

The character of the early settlers of Marion was of the highest type.
Little wonder, then, that it has grown into a city of schools and
churches, that its moral atmosphere has been fairly free from the fetid
breath of vice and crime, and that its intellectual, spiritual, and
social ideals have been largely realized in its system of schools,
number and quality of its churches and church membership, and its
unexcelled fraternal organizations, literary and musical clubs, and
societies. Of ideal location, modern and progressive, its water supply
direct from the noted Bowman springs, clean and wholesome, its people
contented and prosperous, never destined, under the shadow of Cedar
Rapids, to be a great city, but unique, beautiful, the county seat of
the great county of Linn, undoubtedly the prize winning slogan of Cedar
Rapids, with Marion substituted, would be acceptable to every resident:
"Marion suits me."




CHAPTER XLIV

_Linn County in War_


The men and women of Linn county have always been patriotic. They have
responded promptly and cheerfully to every call to arms. One of the
earliest settlers in the county had served in the Revolutionary war.
Nathan Brown, who came here in 1839 and for whom Brown township was
named, at the early age of sixteen years joined the American forces.

T. J. McKean, George A. Gray, A. R. Sausman, William Hampton, S. D.
Thompson, "Democ" Woodbridge, and a Mr. Courtney served in the war with
Mexico. These men all enlisted from this county, entering the service
in June, 1847. J. J. Snouffer, who came to the county in the early days
and who long was an important figure in the business and political life
of Cedar Rapids, was a veteran of this same war.

It is not out of place here to say a word regarding T. J. McKean, the
only man from the county who received the commission of
brigadier-general in the Civil war. General McKean was born in
Pennsylvania in 1810 and entered West Point in 1827, graduating with
honors in 1831. He immediately entered the service with the rank of
lieutenant, and was stationed in Louisiana. Resigning his commission,
for a time he followed the profession of civil engineer. He came to
Marion in 1840, and when war with Mexico was declared he raised a squad
of six men as above and joined Company K, 15th Regulars, the only
company sent out from Iowa. He served in the Mexican war for a year and
a half and then returned to Marion. At the breaking out of the Civil
war he was holding the office of sheriff of the county. He was not able
to resist the call to arms and surrendered his office to accept a post
as paymaster in the Union army. He entered upon his duties early in
1861. In the fall of that year Governor Kirkwood proposed his name for
a brigadier-general. He received that commission and served his country
with ability.

On April 12, 1861, Sumter was fired upon. On the 15th, President
Lincoln issued a call for 75,000 ninety-day men. It was erroneously
believed that our internal difficulties could be adjusted in that
period. Within thirty days after the president's call had reached Iowa
this state had a regiment in the field. In that regiment, the First
Iowa. Linn county had a full company under the command of Capt. T. Z.
Cook.

Before giving a detailed account of the various companies that served
in the Civil war from Linn county, it may be well to treat briefly of
some of the stirring events that were witnessed in the county in the
early days of the war.

The board of supervisors early held a special session to provide means
for the relief of the families of such men as were willing to volunteer
for field service. At the September, 1861, session of that body the
following resolution was adopted: "That the Clerk of the Board of
Supervisors issue an order or orders for the benefit and relief of any
of our volunteers now in the United States service, upon the
certificate and approval of the resident Supervisor of the township in
which the family or applicant resides."

The press and pulpit of the county strongly advocated the cause of the
Union. No conservative position on the burning question was taken by
either. Many are the emphatic appeals to the loyal spirit of the
county. In its issue of April 18, 1861, the _Cedar Valley Times_ has
this to say:

"More than ever, it is now the duty of every true man to respond to the
call of his country. Party ties are broken, party divisions forgotten,
in the common necessity which summons every true American to the
standard of his country--to the defence of our Union, our Constitution,
our liberty and our rights.... Every man to his post, that post the
support of the Administration."

In the same issue there was a call for a meeting on that evening to
obtain an expression of the feelings of the people. This meeting was
held in Carpenter's Hall, Cedar Rapids, and was characterized by great
enthusiasm. Dr. J. H. Camburn presided and Isaac Van Meter acted as
secretary. These gentlemen, together with Porter W. Earle, William
Greene, H. G. Angle, Dr. Taylor, E. N. Bates, W. H. Merritt, and others
gave stirring talks. At this meeting a despatch was read from Gov.
Samuel J. Kirkwood, as follows:

"If Linn county shall tender me a full company of seventy-eight good
men, properly officered, by Thursday of next week, I will offer the
company as one of the regiments required of this state by the President
of the United States."

A committee was appointed to push the matter of raising a company. On
this committee were E. N. Bates, T. Z. Cook, W. H. Merritt, J. H.
Stibbs and W. R. Sweitzer. Twenty-five names were signed that night to
a muster roll.

Other towns of the county were not behind Cedar Rapids in enthusiasm.
On the evening of April 19th a mass meeting was held at Kingston, with
J. H. Elder in the chair. He at once offered his purse to its limit for
the cause. Here Rev. A. G. Eberhart, and Messrs. Churchill, Stewart and
Detwiler were the speakers. Eight men added their names to the roll of
Cedar Rapids volunteers. In Marion a meeting of equal enthusiasm was
held and a full company volunteered. By noon of the 19th thirty-five
men had signed a muster roll in Mt. Vernon. A great crowd gathered in
the chapel of Western college on the evening of the 19th. Young men,
students and others, were urged to enroll for the honor of Linn county
and the cause of the union. Nine were added to the list. The meeting
also contributed five dollars to aid in purchasing bibles for the
company--the boys from Western going with those from this city. On
Monday the 22d, this contingent came to the city, and on the same day
twenty-seven of the Mt. Vernon volunteers were accepted for the first
company from Linn county. Captaincy of the company, K, First Infantry,
fell upon T. Z. Cook.

In Buffalo township there were but twelve voters, and just half of
these volunteered for army service. At Palo a spirited union meeting
was held, and at once thirty-five men pledged their lives to the cause.

The boys at once began drilling under J. J. Snouffer, a veteran of the
Mexican war. Dr. S. D. Carpenter was made quartermaster of the
regiment. On Saturday, May 4, a flag was presented to the company. On
May 6 Company K left for Clinton. Following is roster of the company,
at the time it left Cedar Rapids: Captain, T. Z. Cook; first
lieutenant, J. C. Marvin; second lieutenant, Robert Stinson; orderly,
J. H. Stibbs; second sergeant, J. Van Meter; third sergeant, E.
Coulter; first corporal, R. L. Wilson; second corporal, J. H. Hammond;
third corporal, E. L. Carpenter; fourth corporal, Jos. McClelland.
Privates--Geo. H. Angell, Geo. W. Aylesworth, John Agler, Geo. C.

Granger, Andrew Harmon, Hiel Hale, F. W. Hollingrane, J. J. Hollan,
Perry Hoyt, W. P. Hubbard, Peter Hauger, Charles A. Harper, R. W.

Vandever, J. N. Van Arsdel, L. P. Winterstein, C. Wynn, William Walt,
D. H. Wilson, Geo. H. Yager, L. J. C. Ziengenfus.

The regimental officers were J. F. Bates, Dubuque, colonel; W. H.
Merritt, Cedar Rapids, lieutenant-colonel; A. B. Porter, Mt. Pleasant,
major.

The company before the close of its services endured many hardships. It
took part in the skirmish at Forsythe on July 20. On the evening of the
9th of August the First Iowa, under command of Lieut. Col. Merritt
joined the other forces at Springfield, under Gen. Lyon. Marching to
within three miles of the enemy's camp at Wilson's Creek, the attack
was begun at 3 o'clock on the morning of the 10th. It was a severely
contested engagement. At this battle Gen. Lyon was killed, while
personally leading the First Iowa. Victory was with the Union army and
pursuit of the enemy was continued until nightfall. Following is the
report made by Captain T. Z. Cook of casualties sustained by his
company:

"Killed--Private Perry Hoyt. Seriously wounded--E. Coulter, leg; Henry
Shaffer, leg and arm; John Stine, leg and breast; E. R. McKee, arm; W.
D. Robins, leg; Samuel Daniels, leg. Slightly wounded--J. O. Stewart,
leg; John Fitzgerald, face; Joseph Hollan, foot; J. M. Chase, back;
George F. Schoonover, arm badly bruised by grape shot. Sergeant Coulter
and Privates Shaffer and Stine were left at Springfield. Isaac Van
Meter, second sergeant, and John H. Stibbs, sergeant, particularly
distinguished themselves for coolness and bravery. T. Z. Cook,
captain."

This battle really ended the service of Company K. The regiment was
mustered out at St. Louis August 25 and started at once for home. On
the evening of August 26 the volunteer's returned to Cedar Rapids. The
Kingston Guards, of eighty men, with a local company of about the same
number, furnished an escort and headed by the mayor and council met the
train at the depot. Five thousand people were estimated in the
gathering. The dwellings and stores were illuminated in honor of the
return. A procession was formed and marched to the same place where a
few months before the flag had been presented. On behalf of the city
Mayor Bishop voiced its welcome to the volunteers. Judge Isaac Cook
supplied a little more speech-making and a supper followed of quality
to make these soldiers forget all hardships of camp and march.

In other portions of the county the enthusiasm was as great as it was
in Cedar Rapids. The _Linn County Register_ of April 20, 1861, in
announcing the commencement of hostilities stated that "already, some
seventy-five persons, in the vicinity of Marion alone, have signified
their intention to volunteer under the call of President Lincoln." In
its issue a week later the same paper said that "on every corner the
people are assembled, in squads of a dozen or more, discussing the
chances of the conflict. Men in the country leave their plows, and rush
into town, to inquire about the news."

In the Sixth Infantry, which was mustered in July 6, 1861, Company A
was entirely from this county. It was organized at Marion. The regiment
was mustered out at Louisville, Kentucky, July 21. 1865. It saw some
hard battles, several of its officers being killed in action, and
eighteen wounded. Of the enlisted men 274 were killed or died in the
service, and 331 were wounded in action. It is said that this regiment
suffered more casualties than any other regiment from Iowa. The
regiment suffered severely at Shiloh, Mission Ridge, Resaca, Dallas,
Kenesaw Mountain, and Jackson, Miss.

[Illustration: COL. T. Z. COOK]

Its first captain was Hosea W. Gray, who was succeeded by Tarlton
Caldwell, Willard H. Harland, and Rodney E. Barker, who served as
captains at different periods. A. L. Ingram, who entered the company as
a private, was first lieutenant at the time of mustering out. Other
well known names among the officers of this company are those of George
A. Gray, W. M. Harbeson, A. P. Alexander, Samuel D. Springer, C. A.
Huston, Chas. L. Byam. Among the members of the company are found the
names of T. H. Alexander, Daniel K. Kinley, Chas. Robins, S. A.
Stearns, D. F. Stinson.

George M. Holmes, of this county, entered as sergeant of this regiment,
and was promoted from time to time until he became captain of Company K
on July 30, 1863, resigning October 17, 1864.

In the Eighth Infantry Joseph C. Stoddard, yet a resident of Cedar
Rapids, was commissioned adjutant November 15, 1865, having been
promoted from sergeant-major. Among those from this county in this
regiment may be noted Jno. M. Dawley, J. H. Gardner, Hiram Inks, Wm. H.
Ostrander, David G. Usher, Homer H. Phillips, D. W. Yount.

The county was also represented in the Ninth Infantry, being especially
strong in Company K, in which Abraham Bowman was commissioned second
lieutenant and promoted to the captaincy on January 9, 1864. Its first
captain was David Carskaddon, afterwards colonel of the regiment. Among
the familiar names in this company we find those of David Bowman, Jas.
C. Morehead, Oliver B. Cone, John Cone, John S. McKee, J. M. Burkhart,
W. S. Dingman, John W. Gray, I. N. Lutz, A. R. Whiteneck. The company
was organized in Marion and mustered into the service July 23, 1861.

In the Eleventh Infantry these names are noted: Robt. L. Wilson, Samuel
H. Harrison, Chas. W. Mason, Wm. H. McRoberts, Wm. Burge, Henry M.
Cook, Jno. Coburn, John Elder, E. P. Listabarger, Wm. Mitchell, Jas. D.
McRoberts, And. W. Satley, Thos. Strang, John B. Stine, Geo. W. Sparks,
Samuel Shafer, Wm. A. Thompson. Company K of this regiment was
organized in Cedar Rapids, John C. Marvin, captain. It was mustered in
July 23, 1861.

Company D, Twelfth Iowa Infantry, was captained by John H. Stibbs. The
regiment was organized at Dubuque and mustered into the service
November 25, 1861, with Joseph P. Woods, a West Pointer, as colonel;
John P. Coulter of Cedar Rapids, lieutenant-colonel, and S. D.
Brodtbeck, major. The Twelfth was then ordered to St. Louis. The Linn
county company was organized in Cedar Rapids, and mustered in October
26, 1861.

First of the year 1862 found seventeen members of the company in
hospitals. A malignant outbreak of measles at that time caused many
deaths in the Twelfth and other regiments.

During the week ending January 15, 1862, Capt. Stibbs, in a letter to
his brother in Cedar Rapids, reported that six of his men had died in
hospital. These were William H. Webster, William L. Dailey, John L.
Jaques, John S. Lee, Jasper Cyner and Henry Haradon. Seventeen others
were in various hospitals at St. Louis. On Saturday, January 11, the
regiment was ordered to be ready to start for Kentucky on the 15th, but
because of ice in the river, these orders were countermanded. On the
27th it was ordered to report to Gen. Grant at Cairo. From thence the
regiment was sent to the mouth of the Cumberland river, and established
its camp in the field. On February 5 it joined the expedition against
Fort Henry.

The company was at Ft. Donelson when it capitulated. The regiment
remained at Fort Donelson until March 12, when it was moved to
Pittsburg Landing. On the evening of the 9th of April news was received
of a great battle at Pittsburg Landing, in which the Twelfth Iowa had
share. It was only known that slaughter had been immense, and until
full details were received the anxiety in Cedar Rapids can be imagined.
Yet how slow this news was in coming may be judged from an editorial
note in the _Cedar Valley Times_ for April 17: "Three of our Iowa
regiments--the Eighth, Twelfth and Fourteenth--were cut off and taken
prisoners while bravely defending their flag and the glory of their
country. They fought like tigers. We are not yet able to publish full
lists of losses, and the anxiety so long felt must continue."

The report made by Lieutenant-Colonel Coulter gave the following
returns for Company D: Killed--First Lieutenant James B. Ferguson;
Privates Daniel Luther and James P. Ayres. Wounded--Sergeant J. M.
Clark, Corporal Joseph Stibbs, H. C. Morehead and H. Panborn, all
slightly; Privates J. G. Clark and Frank Renchin, severely. R. C.
Cowell and Ed. H. Bailey, slightly. Missing--(prisoners)--Capt. J. H.
Stibbs, Second Lieutenant Hiel Hale, Orderly Sergeant R. Hilton;
Corporals H. W. Ross and J. J. Broughton; Privates L. M. Ayres, Ed.
Buttolph, Samuel Baumgardner, Thomas Barr, J. W. Burch, S. Birch, P.
Brennan, D. L. Conley, D. Conley, F. Dubois, S. A. Flint, W. A. Flint,
A. J. Frees, C. Ferrerbend, H. Grass, P. Gephart, A. Hill, R. L.
Johnson, Eli King, William Lee, John Luther, T. J. Lewis, Wm. B. Lutz,
J. Lanagan, E. B. Martin, A. J. Milen, D. W. Minor, R. McClain, J.
Nicholas, J. O. Sartwell, D. Sivets, J. Scott, L. Snell, R. K. Soper,
A. A. Stewart, J. M. Garponning, W. H. Trowbridge, W. Whitenack, J. J.
Whittam, J. Wagner, J. Craft, F. Curren, R. P. Zuver, A. McIntyre.

Lieutenant Jason D. Ferguson, one of the killed, was at the outbreak of
the war a student in Cornell College. He was one of that gallant band
who left their studies to take up men's work. He was a member of
Company K, First Iowa, serving throughout the brief but arduous
campaign in which that regiment participated. His efforts were untiring
in organization of Company D, of the Twelfth.

But the losses of Linn county soldiers were not confined to those of
Company D, of the Twelfth Iowa in the battle of Pittsburg Landing.
Quartermaster Mortimer A. Higley sent back to friends in this city, a
list of those in Company A, Fifteenth Iowa, there killed and wounded.
Among the killed were Pat H. Kennedy and Wm. W. Wood, privates, both of
Cedar Rapids. Wounded, Corporal John Kimbro, in arm, severely;
privates, Elisha Hopkins, severely; Charles Stewart, slightly; Jacob
Brown, severely; Newton Dawson, and Henry Bunn, slightly, all being
from Linn county.

The Twelfth Iowa regiment was mustered out and the members from this
county returned home during the last week of January. Company D,
enlisted in 1866, came home with the following Cedar Rapids survivors:
S. R. Burch, adjutant; Homer Morehead, regimental quartermaster; John
Clark, captain; Eli King, first lieutenant; N. G. Price, orderly
sergeant; H. Pangborn, John Burch, I. G. Clark, B. P. Zuver, sergeants;
J. Lanagan, John Luther, R. C. Cowell, Josiah Scott, R. L. Johnson, P.
Brennan, A. A. Stewart, T. Lewis, corporals; S. Baumgardner, John
Whittam, Wm. Whiteneck, J. W. Rowen, W. H. Trowbridge, A. J. Freese, R.
S. Martin, J. B. Lambert, Daniel Sivetts, Sam H. Flint, H. Grass, F.
Dubois, H. Ross, Wm. Lee and R. K. Soper, privates. Citizens of Cedar
Rapids and Kingston gave a reception to these returned soldiers on the
evening of February 6. This took form of a ball at Daniels' Hall and a
supper served at the American House.

The Thirteenth Infantry was organized at Mt. Vernon and mustered in
July 23, 1861, John Q. Wild, captain. Chas. W. Kepler was a captain and
E. R. Mason a sergeant. Among the members were Geo. W. Doty, Jacob W.
Easterly, Chas. Gardner, Jos. M. Harper, S. P. Harman, D. A. Hamilton,
Jas. E. Neal, Robt. W. Thompson, Wm. Thompson, F. A. Varner, Thos. W.

In the Fourteenth Infantry Jos. Legore was a corporal, and a number
enlisted in the regiment from this county. The same is true of the
Fifteenth. Sixteenth and Eighteenth regiments. Company A of the
Fifteenth was composed largely of Linn county men. M. A. Higley was
first lieutenant in this company and later a major in the commissary
department.

The Eighteenth regiment was organized at Clinton, but Company A was
made up almost entirely of men from this county. T. Z. Cook, of Cedar
Rapids, was lieutenant-colonel of the regiment.

On July 9, 1862, Governor Kirkwood called for five additional infantry
regiments from Iowa. In response to this call a "mass war meeting" was
held in Cedar Rapids on the evening of July 22. E. G. Brown was
chairman and J. H. Elder, secretary. The result of this meeting was the
organization of Company A, 20th Iowa. Many of the most substantial
citizens of Cedar Rapids for the time being laid aside their private
business to engage in raising men for the war.

The Twentieth Iowa Volunteer Infantry was composed of five companies
from Linn county and five from Scott county. The companies from this
county were A, B, F, H, and I. They were mustered into service August
25, 1862. The company went from here to Clinton and from there to
Davenport. On September 5 they took the boat for St. Louis. The
regiment experienced several hard marches in Missouri and Arkansas; it
took part in the siege of Vicksburg, saw service in Louisiana and
Texas; was in the attack on Mobile, and was mustered out there July 8,
1865.

William McE. Dye, of Marion, was colonel of the regiment, William G.
Thompson was major. Dr. Henry Ristine was surgeon, C. S. Lake,
adjutant, and J. S. Lake, commissary sergeant. Company A was captained
by E. N. Bates, Company B by Edward Coulter, Company F by N. M.
Hubbard, Company H by R. H. Lucore, and Company I by C. C. Cook. Among
the well known Linn county men in this regiment may be mentioned the
following: Milo Adams, W. H. Boyce, John H. Culp, George W. Homer,
Robert Keeler, George W. Mentzer, John D. Mounce, C. E. and Daniel W.

Capt. J. O. Stewart, long clerk in Cedar Rapids of the U. S. District
Court, entered Company B of this regiment as first sergeant. In March,
1863, he was appointed second lieutenant and in 1864 commissioned
captain. For a year and a half he acted as adjutant of the regiment.

Companies F, G. and H in the Twenty-fourth Infantry were from Linn
county. E. C. Byam was for a time colonel of this regiment, John F. Sly
was surgeon, John Q. Wilds, of Mt. Vernon, was lieutenant colonel. C.
L. Byam, D. W. Camp and William H. Smouse were adjutants, F. W. Vinson
was both a captain and chaplain. W. C. Dimmett was captain of Company
F. John G. Hayzlett and C. H. Kurtz were first lieutenants, T. L.
Smith, A. T. Waln were second lieutenants, and among the members of
this company may be noted the following: William Camp, Andrew Doty,
John W. Firkins, John F. Goudy, John Geiger, William Hall, John A. Ide,
Samuel Johnson, J. H. Kepler, A. Lacock, William McQuiston, John
Peddycoard, John Renfrew. This company was organized at Mt. Vernon.

W. W. Smith was captain of Company G and among the members of this
company were George F. Coleman, James Morrison, David Briggs, A. Cox,
H. H. Felton, Jacob Grow, J. G. Hall, D. W. King, Daniel Matson, John
L. Ogan, John F. Prather, Willis Vance, John H. Worden. This company
was organized in Cedar Rapids.

Of Company H William Carbee was captain. Among the other officers were
F. A. Jones, I. B. Dutton, William C. Glover, George W. Martin, J. H.
Shanklin, Josiah Bundy, and among the members may be noted Michael
Boyer, C. H. Burlingham, Joe L. Bundy, John B. Bowman, C. H. Branch,
David Ely, Z. V. Elsbery, C. R. Elsbery, E. R. Gregg, M. Griffith, T.
J. Gibson, Benjamin W. Gibson, Joseph Hyatt, F. C. Hunter, I. Lambert,
Charles Penn, D. J. Post, J. S. Vernon, David C. Winans, and John
Yount.

This company was recruited from Springville, Waubeek, and Prairieburg.

The Thirty-first Infantry, Company A, Robert Stinson, captain, was
recruited in northeastern Linn county and was organized at Marion.
William Smyth, of Marion, was colonel of the regiment, G. L. Carhart
surgeon, L. H. Mason and A. J. Twogood quartermasters, Milo P. Smith
sergeant-major, and Donald Lothian commissary sergeant. J. S.
Alexander, at present postmaster at Marion, was promoted to the
captaincy of Company A on June 14, 1864. Dyer Usher and John H. Harvey
were lieutenants in this company, John M. Robbins, Hiram Deem, Jesse
Abbott, Richard Abbott, Alfred Stinson and A. P. McKinley sergeants.

Linn county was represented in the Thirty-seventh Infantry by men in
Companies A, D, G, H and I. Jas. S. Morehead, George A. Calder, G. L.
Snyder are familiar names on the roster of this regiment. Company A was
organized in Cedar Rapids with John Hogendabler as captain. The company
was made up of men from Linn, Benton and Blackhawk counties. The
regiment was known as the "Grey Beards."

Toward the close of the war some 100-day regiments were organized in
Iowa. The county had men in these also--John S. Harrison, J. T.
Christian, Geo. W. Bever, Henry S. Bever, B. F. Snyder, Geo. S.
Bushnell, I. S. Barger, John Allsbaugh, H. O. Kearns, R. N. Maudsley,
S. H. Metcalf, N. H. Martin, P. Otterbein, Homer H. Phelps, and others.
Half of Company E, 46th, Infantry were from Linn county. John Harrison
of Cedar Rapids, was the captain. David B. Henderson, of Dubuque, was
colonel of the regiment.

The county had also scattered representation in several cavalry
regiments.

According to the reports of the adjutant general of Iowa, out of a
population of 18,947, Linn county furnished 1,737 men for the army from
1861 to 1864 inclusive.

It is scarcely possible to sum up in brief space what Linn county did
in raising men for the war. Company K of the First Iowa. Company D of
the Twelfth, the companies raised by Captains E. N. Bates, C. C. Cook,
R. H. Lucore, N. M. Hubbard, and J. P. Coulter, had already gone out
from the county or were ready to enter the service early in 1862. W. W.
Smith and Rev. F. W. Vinson had also a full company. More than fifty
men had been recruited at Western, seventy-five at Springville, a full
company at Mount Vernon, some fifty additional men at Marion, and a
company was then forming at Center Point.

In its issue for August 21, the _Times_ stated: "Within the past two
weeks she [Linn county] has sent five companies out, and four others,
full and organized, are waiting orders to leave. A tenth company will
soon be filled. Nothing less than a regiment will satisfy the martial
feeling prevailing in our county."

On Monday, August 18, the companies of Captain Cook, Lucore, and
Coulter, about 250 in all, left Cedar Rapids for Clinton. Captain
Vinson's company was filled on August 20, with Sheriff W. W. Smith as
first lieutenant. This company was made a part of the Twenty-fourth, or
"Temperance" regiment. Mr. Vinson later resigned as captain to accept a
position as chaplain of the regiment. In the meantime Captain T. Z.
Cook had received a commission as lieutenant colonel of the Eighteenth
Iowa. At the time he was mayor of Cedar Rapids but resigned and Charles
Weare was appointed in his place.

[Illustration: SAMPLES OF CURRENCY USED IN PIONEER DAYS The lower two
signed by John Weare, President]

In April, 1862, Dr. J. H. Camburn, of Cedar Rapids, was commissioned as
surgeon of the Sixteenth Iowa and about the same time Dr. R. R. Taylor
was appointed as medical officer of the Fourth cavalry, then stationed
at Benton Barracks, St. Louis.

To speak at length of the services rendered in the field by the men
from Linn county is not possible at this time. Our boys all
distinguished themselves for bravery, and suffered patiently the many
privations to which they were subjected. Many of them saw hard service,
and quite a number were taken prisoners. At Shiloh among the Linn
county officers made prisoners were Capt. John H. Stibbs, and Lieut.
Hiel Hale of Company D, Twelfth Iowa. These officers were later
released on exchange. Captain Ed Coulter of the Twentieth Iowa fell
into the hands of the enemy down in Texas. It seems that officers of
the Twentieth were somewhat unfortunate. Major W. G. Thompson was badly
wounded at the battle of Prairie Grove. Captain Bates resigned because
of ill health, returned home, and died. Captain Lucore became ill with
the small pox and also died. Captain C. C. Cook resigned on account of
sickness, and was succeeded by Joseph McClelland, who at the time was
ill in New Orleans. Lieutenant Joseph Holland resigned and came home
sick, dying soon afterward.

Company A of the Thirty-first Iowa reached Cedar Rapids after being
discharged on July 3, 1865. This company went into the war 100 strong
and returned with only about forty. Early in August of this same year,
the three companies from Linn county in the Twenty-fourth Iowa reached
home. Of Company C there were only twenty of the original members left.

On the 7th of September, 1865, Cedar Rapids gave the returning soldiers
a big reception. The elaborateness of the reception was greatly marred
by a heavy rainfall. The spirit manifested was all right, however.


COMPANY C, CEDAR RAPIDS

One of the best known military companies in the state is Company C, of
Cedar Rapids. This company was organized November 1, 1883, its first
captain being George Greene. Many of the best known young men of the
town at one time or another have been members of this organization.

After serving a number of years Captain Greene resigned, and for a
short time W. G. Dows was acting captain. Ed. II. Smith was then chosen
to the position. He was succeeded by George A. Evans.

W. G. Dows, long a member of this company, for a time was adjutant of
the First Regiment Iowa National Guards.

Upon the call for troops because of the Spanish-American war, on April
25, 1898, the entire membership of Company C left that same night for
Des Moines, where the entire First Regiment was assembled. This
regiment was mustered into the United States service as the Forty-ninth
Iowa United States Volunteer Infantry. William G. Dows, colonel,
commanding. After drilling for a time they went to Jacksonville,
Florida, and then to Savannah, Georgia, where they took a government
transport for Cuba. The members of the regiment did all kind of service
in the army of occupation, much of it being very laborious. In May,
1899, the regiment returned from Cuba and shortly afterwards was
mustered out at Savannah.

While the company was in the service in Cuba George A. Evans was its
captain.

A few months later the present Fifty-third Regiment was organized, each
city in the old regiment being allowed a company in the new. Company C
was reorganized, and is now a part of this regiment. The first captain
of the new company was Frank Hahn. He was succeeded by T. A. Berkebile,
and he by John Rau, who is now the captain of the company.

Col. William G. Dows, who is now a member of the governor's staff,
served for twenty-five years in various capacities in the same
regiment, a service for continuity unequalled. Though offered
promotions, he maintained that he would rather stay by the old boys and
the old regiment.


FIFTH IOWA BATTERY

Promptly upon the declaration of war in 1898 with Spain a battery was
organized in Cedar Rapids for service in that war. It was mustered into
the service as the Fifth Battery Iowa Volunteer Light Artillery. Nearly
all of the 100 members came from Cedar Rapids and vicinity. The members
were enrolled during April and May, and the battery was mustered in at
Des Moines in June by Major Olmsted of the U. S. regulars. The battery
saw no regular service, but it spent ten weeks in camp waiting, ready
for service in the field if called upon. George W. Bever was the
captain, R. Tasker Forbes and S. Craighead Cook, lieutenants, Charles
A. Loring was first sergeant, Robert M. Witwer, quartermaster sergeant.
Dr. C. H. French and Roy Waite were also sergeants in the company.




CHAPTER XLV

_Odds and Ends of History and Reminiscence_


In this chapter we give some odds and ends of history and reminiscence
that could not well be inserted elsewhere or that came into our
possession after the foregoing chapters were written:

The result of the vote in Linn county in 1860 showed 2,227 for Lincoln
electors, 1,220 for Douglas, 24 for Breckinridge, and 84 for Bell. In
Rapids township Lincoln had 397, Douglas 201, Breckinridge 3, and Bell
26.

The first telegraph line reached Cedar Rapids February 24, 1860.

On the evening of Sunday, June 3, 1860, a destructive storm occurred,
since known as "The Great Tornado." It was most destructive about five
miles north of Cedar Rapids, and passed southward, leaving the county
in the vicinity of Western. Some lives were lost and many buildings
destroyed.


THE TOWN OF WESTERN

Western was laid out in March, 1856, under the auspices of the United
Brethren church, with the design of forming proper surroundings for the
college. Ground was first broken in June of that year. By August, 1857,
there were forty-three dwelling houses and three hundred inhabitants.
One college building had been completed. This was of brick, three
stories in height, 36 by 62 feet. This was placed upon a campus of
seventeen acres. Rev. S. Weaver was first president of this
institution. The plan was to operate a large farm in connection with
the college, that students might earn their way. In this new town there
were already two stores, one hotel built and one building, a blacksmith
shop, two physicians, and fourteen busy carpenters. Land in the
vicinity was worth from $10 to $20 per acre. Its quality was proven
when the college president, on his own farm, raised 1,800 bushels of
wheat. There was a railroad coming there, of course, as there was one
prospected to nearly every cross-roads in the state. This particular
line was the Iowa Union, to run from Cedar Rapids to Iowa City.

Western was above all things a moral town. One Daniel Quin having
opened a grog shop near the place, where the college authorities could
not interfere, the people took up the matter. Sentiment was aroused and
a mass meeting was held. At this meeting resolutions were adopted,
which provided that a committee should wait upon the dram seller and
urge him to desist. In case of his refusal the committee was to try
legal methods for his suppression. If these proved ineffective the
meeting was to be again called, to devise further measures. A very
significant addendum was that the meeting would support the committee
in any plan which might be considered necessary to eradicate the
obnoxious business. It was further resolved to use the boycott--though
the Irish captain had not yet given his name to the scheme. In other
words they were not to employ or trade with any man engaged in the
liquor business or who might in any way support the traffic. It is
perhaps needless to say that Quin surrendered at discretion without
forcing the committee and the people to extremities hinted at.


MT. VERNON

Mt. Vernon makes showing in several directions during 1857. The
Congregationalists of that town being without a place of worship were
enabled to rent from the Covenanters. But by the terms of the lease
with that strict body promise was made that no minister of pro-slavery
sentiments should be heard within the building, nor upon any occasion
was a musical instrument of any description to be used therein. The
institution at Mt. Vernon which had before this time been known as
"Iowa Conference Seminary," was in August, 1857, changed in name to
Cornell College. And Mt. Vernon, like the other college town of
Western, was careful for civic peace and righteousness. Christianity in
that time and in a new country was required sometimes to be of a
stalwart and muscular kind, that it might meet evil tendencies sharply
and effectively. Thus we learn of the discomfitures of a gang of
rowdies from Linn Grove, who invaded the peace of Mt. Vernon and
disturbed its Sabbath quietude, with intent to break up a religious
meeting then in progress. These were overcome, after a tussle, by the
worshippers, and held until passing of midnight brought a civic day.
Then the justice was roused, the disturbers formally accused, tried and
fined to the utmost extent of their resources. The affair was over
before one o'clock Monday morning, the rowdies started home with empty
pockets, sadder and wiser men, and the godly inhabitants of Mt. Vernon
again slept the sleep of the just.


FIRST AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION

The Linn County Agricultural and Mechanical Association was organized
in 1855, its first meeting being held at Cedar Rapids in May of that
year. The organization was completed in July. The object, as stated,
was "the encouragement of agriculture, manufactures and the mechanic
arts." To accomplish this laudable purpose an annual county fair was to
be held. The first of these was at Cedar Rapids in September, 1855, and
the second at Marion the next year. These are reported as very
creditable in exhibits, and fairly well attended. In 1857 the
association was incorporated, and in consequence drew $200 from the
state treasury. The third fair was again at Cedar Rapids, and the
management took the public into its confidence in advance by revealing
its slender resources. The premiums for '56 were not paid, but those of
the next year were very promptly met, and a surplus remained over for
the future. These annual fairs were recognized as something to be aided
by all parties, and the various toll bridges notified intending
exhibitors that all live stock taken to the fair would be passed free.

The statement of the association for 1860 shows total income of
$462.00, of which amount $259.00 represented the gate receipts. The
expenditures were $414.95, including $146.98 for premiums. The
indebtedness of the society had increased to $618.65. The amount
received from the state each year was $200.00. Officers elected for
1861 were: President, Charles Taylor, Cedar Rapids; vice presidents,
Andrew Safely and W. S. Gott, Marion; secretary, S. D. McCauley, Cedar
Rapids; treasurer, Lysander Jones, Marion.


FIRST TEACHERS ASSOCIATION

Another organization, though having nominal existence before this time,
was really made effective in 1857. This was the Linn County Teachers'
Association.

On October 31, on call of J. L. Enos, the teachers and others
interested met in Cedar Rapids. Mr. Enos was then editor of the _Voice
of Iowa_, the educational organ of the state. At this meeting a
reorganization of the association was effected, and officers elected as
follows: President, Rev. S. Weaver, president of Western college; vice
presidents, Prof. S. M. Fellows of Mt. Vernon, E. A. Cooley of Marion,
Ira G. Fairbanks of Cedar Rapids; secretary, Prof. N. W. Bartlett,
Western; treasurer, Hon. E. N. Bates of Cedar Rapids. The executive
committee consisted of M. Bowman, Franklin township; S. M. Bruce,
Washington; William Parmenter, Western; J. L. Enos, Cedar Rapids; and
A. Witter, Franklin. The work of preparing a constitution was committed
to J. L. Enos, E. A. Cooley, and Ira G. Fairbanks. A further meeting of
the association was held at Western, December 12th, at which time the
constitution was adopted and the organization started on a very useful
existence.

[Illustration: STREET VIEWS IN CEDAR RAPIDS, IN 1910]


FIRST TEACHER'S CERTIFICATE IN CEDAR RAPIDS

The first teacher's certificate issued in Rapids township reads as
follows:

"This certifies that I have this day examined Miss Susan A. Abbe,
touching her ability to teach, both in regard to her education and to
her moral character, and I find her well qualified for a teacher of
common schools.

     "This certificate shall be valid for one year.

     "Rapids township, Linn county, Iowa, July 16, 1847.

                                  "Alexander L. Ely,
          "Inspector of Common Schools for said Township."


Alexander L. Ely was one of the early settlers of Cedar Rapids, was
interested in the public matters of the new town, and early engaged in
politics. He was also largely interested in real estate, and operated
one of the first mills on the Cedar river at the dam, which he caused
to be built with N. B. Brown and other leading citizens.

Susan A. Abbe, the person to whom this certificate was issued, is still
living in Hollister, California, and is known as Mrs. Susan Shields.
She was seventeen years when the certificate was issued, and had then
been a resident of the county ten years. She taught for a number of
years in the public schools of this county.

Mrs. Shields maintains that she was the first legally qualified person
to teach in the public schools of Cedar Rapids, according to the laws
then in force in the state.

The evidence seems to confirm her contention.


TEACHERS' INSTITUTE

A teachers' institute, first of which record is made and notable in
point of attendance, was held in Cedar Rapids December 26, 1859, and
continued for three days. There was constant drilling for the
pedagogues in common school branches. Some sixty teachers were present.

Linn county teachers held their institute for 1860 at Western October
29-30, with Prof. F. Humphrey of Cedar Rapids, president. Some of the
subjects discussed may serve to illustrate differences in the times.
Question of teachers (presumably male) using tobacco came up, and a
resolution was adopted expressing "disapproval of the use of tobacco by
teachers, and recommend to those of Linn county to abstain therefrom
entirely." Dr. J. Maynard of Tipton made an address on the subject of
"Children's Rights." Prof. Wheeler of Cornell orated on "Demosthenes."
Editor Jerome of the Iowa City _Republican_ urged teachers to use the
press as an ally in the cause of education.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mrs. Ruth A. Dale, of Cedar Rapids, sister of Elias Doty, now living
near Bertram, where the family settled in the early days--1839--has
distinct recollections of pioneer life in the county. She states that
Aretas Crane and Daniel C. Doty, brothers of Elias and James M. Doty,
the pioneers, settled at Ft. Stevens, now Davenport, in 1836 or
1837--1836 she believes is the correct date. Daniel Doty and his son,
J. M. Doty, and his son-in-law, Aretas Crane, passed over the ground on
which Cedar Rapids now stands in 1837. This being the fact, it is
evident that these people were the first white men to look upon the
present site of the city, with a view to finding a permanent settlement
for themselves. They, however, after looking over the ground concluded
that the site afterwards known as Westport, and somewhat later as
Newark, was the preferable location. They returned to their home at
Middletown, Butler county, Ohio, and arranged their affairs. James M.
Doty and Elias Doty, sons of Daniel Doty, returned to the county in
1839 and took up a claim at Westport. There they started what was,
without question, the first manufacturing plant within the limits of
the county, and possibly in the state. This was a pottery. The date of
its establishment was probably in 1840. Later the same year Elias Doty
began the erection of the first saw-mill in the county.

The Dotys were induced to come to Iowa through the fact that their
brother, Daniel C. Doty, was at the time engaged in steamboating on the
Mississippi, his headquarters being at Davenport.

In this connection the following extracts from a letter written by
Elias and J. M. Doty to their parents and dated May 2, 1841, are of
interest:

     "I have my mill frame up, that is, the lower frame. The upper
     frame is almost ready to raise. The millwright work can be
     done in about six weeks from the time we raise the frame. I
     have commenced the race. I have three hundred feet in length
     of a race and two hundred feet dam. As soon as I get water to
     it, it will be ready to run.

     "There are hard times enough here for anybody. There is
     nothing that will bring cash that I know of. For my part I am
     hard run to live. I would like to have some money. It has not
     come yet.

     "I cannot say that we are all well, but we are able to keep
     about. We had a great deal of sickness last fall. I cannot
     say that I like this country, it is too cold for me, the
     ground freezes from two to four feet deep. The frost is
     hardly out yet. The trees look like winter time. I think I
     will leave this place as soon as I can get my business
     settled, and money enough to carry me away. I have between
     two and three hundred dollars coming but can't get enough to
     buy myself a shirt. I bought corn last fall at three cents
     per bushel. I have three claims and want to sell them.

     "Last night was a pretty moonlight night. Parmelia kicked up
     a fuss and after all night's watching about six o'clock this
     morning after a bright sunrise she was delivered of a
     prosperous looking son, weight nine pounds, seven ounces."

SOME MUNICIPAL FIGURES FOR CEDAR RAPIDS

The net taxable value of property in Cedar Rapids for the year 1910, on
the one-fourth valuation, is $6,579,183. In addition the city has a
mulct tax revenue and an income from licenses, police court fines,
etc., of about $60,000 per year, giving a little more than $300,000
available for city purposes.

The real estate valuation for 1910 is $21,280,294, and the personal
property is valued at $5,026,438. The valuation twelve years ago was
one-half of the above amount. It has increased at the rate of one
million dollars per year since 1898. This increase is largely due to
improvements and new buildings. Land values have doubled in the past
twelve years. For 1911 the valuation will go above these values as the
city has increased in value so fast that it will be necessary for the
assessors to raise the valuation on all property for 1911 at least
three million dollars, which will bring the total valuation to nearly
thirty millions by 1912.


EARLY DAYS IN LINN

IN CEDAR RAPIDS REPUBLICAN JUNE 20, 1910

Being in a somewhat reflective mood today I shall attempt to acquaint
you of a few incidents in a life as memory unfolds them to me. It will
be necessary before narrating these incidents to introduce to you my
friend and acquaintance, Colonel McIntyre of Indian Creek bottom,
familiarly known as "Pinkey" by his class mates at West Point. The
colonel measured six feet two, symmetrically proportioned, tipping the
scale at a trifle over two hundred pounds, eyes of steel grey, beard
auburn, bordering slightly on the reddish and a military bearing in
keeping with his long years of service as a disciplinarian. The
incidents of this life take me back some years to that little cabin,
that stood on the east side of the road running north and south past
Indian creek bottom, built from roughly finished logs hewn from the
trunks of trees cut from the nearby forest. Time does not seem to
efface from memory recollections with the boys and girls of the
sparsely settled neighborhood, attending spelling schools and such
like. The unfolding of memory reveals to me versions of the old place
and the childhood days spent beneath the clapboard roof as vividly as
though it were but yesterday.

A little farther on up the road from this cabin, perhaps a half mile,
there is a fork in the road, one fork leading on to what was then known
as Turkey Grove and now to feather ridge, the other on to the Inn
dwellers cave on the "Pinican" bluffs. On the flat iron point where the
road forks was erected the first school house in that vicinity and is
still standing as a monument to the men who were not afraid to do what
they knew to be right regardless of the whims and petty clamorings of
dissatisfaction that continually sway committees from the paths of
rectitude and right. From this nucleus of education there go forth its
quota of youth each year to enter higher institutions of learning or
grapple with the more serious problems of life. The impressions I
received while attending this school by the pleasant grove have not
been eradicated by the conquering of new worlds or by the glamour of
political conquests. Youthful dreams and the bewitching smile of some
fair maid were a source of great pleasure to me; a smile from Miss Rose
LaBelle during school time would set my heart going at a two minute
clip and detract materially from my studies and the routine of school
work.

From this miniature "college" have gone forth men and women who are now
wielding an influence almost nation wide in its scope. Some are
gradually wandering from the truths that were enunciated and make a
cardinal principle of its teaching and are now searching in hidden
paths of sociology for new light. I now recall an event that happened
while attending this school that conveys to my mind another fact
tending to establish the truth of the proposition, that "ingratitude"
is no dream.

One bright morning in early spring when all nature seemed aglow with
freshness and beauty, myself and a number of girls were the first to
arrive at school, the teacher, Miss Theresa McCurty, being a little
later than usual. On entering the school house we were held spellbound
and speechless for a moment by a strange musical yet weird sound which
seemed to come from the rear of the room. It took considerable effort
to muster up courage to make an investigation, but finally a search was
started and on approaching the rear end of the room the same musical
weird sound would be at the other end of the room. Now in order to
discover what it was that was making this strange weird noise and put
the intruder to rout and discover if possible what kind of a looking
monster he was, it was decided that two of us would go around to the
rear and the rest remain in front and keep a sharp lookout for whatever
it might be, when all at once one of the girls let out an unearthly
scream and pointing at some object in the corner of the room shouted,
"There it goes." We all gave chase, although some of the girls were
rather timid on the start, and succeeded in capturing the intruder
alive. It turned out to be a large white wood-mouse. What to do with
this new and unruly possession was the important question now up for
solution. Some were in for dispatching it at once, others said let's
turn it loose, but Miss Orrie, who always had an eye for business when
there was any fun in sight, suggested putting it in the teacher's desk
and the result was that Miss Orrie had her way and we proceeded with
all haste to carry out her plan, the girls holding up the lid of the
old fashioned teacher's desk while I dropped the musical wonder in.
This done, we went about our play as though nothing was ever expected
to happen, impatiently waiting for something to happen, but not quite
sure what. We didn't have long to wait.

Now the teacher, Miss Theresa McCurty, was of the type of spinsters who
are apparently self-willed and thoroughly versed in the art of throwing
round them an atmosphere of ability to convince others of their
dependence only on themselves in case of emergency to take care of
themselves.

We had barely completed the capture and imprisonment in the teacher's
desk of the musical wonder, when Miss McCurty arrived, ready for her
day's work of training the youthful intellect. It seemed as if this
morning in particular she was more precise than ever and went about her
work very deliberately.

It was her custom (a custom that the "Blasting at the Rock of Ages"
ought not to minimize) to read a chapter from some book of the bible
every morning to the scholars before commencing the further duties of
the day, and that chapter which speaks about bearing false witness was
the one chosen for this morning, a very fitting prelude too, to the
further developments of the day. We were more prompt than usual in
taking our seats after school was called this morning with an evident
desire to impress the teacher as being very attentive to our studies,
but at the same time keeping one eye in the teacher's direction, so as
not to miss any of the movements of the teacher in case the anticipated
fun was thrust upon us. Lowell Taylor, the boy who couldn't keep still
if he had to, was bubbling over with mirth (every school has them) and
was severely reproved for not keeping quiet and for disturbing the
whole school by his antics. After delivering to Lowell this short
lecture on disobedience she went to her desk to get her bible and as
she lifted the lid out jumped the prisoner and such a screech as she
let out seemed to almost freeze the marrow in your bones and sent the
cold chills chasing up and down your spinal column as with one bound
she made the first row of seats and in a jiffy was clean to the farther
end of the room, perched upon the rear desk with her skirts tucked
snugly around her shaking limbs and terror pictured in every line of
her face.

In this position she remained impervious to all efforts to induce her
to come off her high perch, until a second chase had been made and the
intruder ejected from the room.

By recess time she had again settled back in the old well beaten path
and assumed her usual calm and dignified way, her reason, which had
been so suddenly dethroned by the advent of the harmless mouse, was
again gaining mastery of the situation. With the return of reason came
the tangled threads of suspicion, that perhaps she had been the victim
of a designing bunch of scholars and that a huge joke had been
perpetrated on her. With this object in view she began a systematic
search for evidence and among the girls she struck a responsive chord.
They were ready to convict any one in order to exculpate themselves.
They gave the whole plot away and every last one of them persisted in
their innocence so eloquently that the teacher was fully convinced of
my guilt. She therefore proceeded to relieve her pent up feelings by
putting into action several of her "suffragette" ideas about personal
liberty. She restrained me of mine for the next two weeks during the
noon hour.


EARLY DOCTORS IN THE COUNTY

The following extracts from a paper read in December, 1910, before the
Iowa Union Medical Society at its meeting in Cedar Rapids, by Dr. H. W.
Sigworth, of Anamosa, himself a pioneer physician in Linn county, is of
interest:

I left northeastern Linn county thirty-four years ago.

In 1856 I commenced the study of medicine in Pennsylvania. After that I
was a tramp schoolmaster, farmer, student at Wisconsin university, and
U. S. soldier. I graduated from Rush in '63. After looking for a
location in Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin, I located at
Waubeek--think of it--in Waubeek, in Maine township, in 1863.

I had tried it a month at Fairview, in Jones county, before going to
Waubeek. By the way, old Dr. Ristine made his first start in Iowa in
the same historic town of Fairview before locating in Marion.

Northeastern Linn county at that time was very much on the frontier.
There were no bridges on the Wapsie from Quasqueton to Anamosa, but at
Central City; now there are five. At Waubeek we had a postoffice but no
regular mail carrier. Any one going to Marion took the mail sack and
brought back the mail.

Our first mail route was on Friday morning. It left Quasqueton
horseback, making Paris, Central City (which was formerly called
Clark's Ford), Waubeek, Necot (Perkins), Anamosa. Saturday it would
return over the same route.

The earliest doctor of whom I can get any word of locating in this
territory was Doctor Ashby at Paris. When I came in 1863, Doctor
Patterson was at Central City. Dr. Lanning was at Paris. He sat next to
me at Rush in 1861 and 1862. Dr. Stacy lived out the Anamosa and
Quasqueton road at Valley farm. I never met him. He sent me my first
case of fractured thigh in June of 1863; a boy, eight years old, who
lived in a sod house with a board roof, two miles north of McQueen's
(now Hill's Mill), now owned by Coquillette. The splints were made with
an axe and pocket knife out of an old cradle found on the roof of the
house. Extension on the ankle was by the top of an old shoe with
strings through the foot-piece of the Liston splint. Results all right.

At Paris, after Lanning came Drs. Byam, Mrs. Dr. Byam, and my brother,
M. P. Sigworth, Fullerton, McTavish, and Ellis, all of whom I knew, and
not one of them alive now.

Where the thriving village of Prairieburg now is was a cross road, the
northeast corner lying out to commons for years.

The first doctor to locate there was Dr. Young. He drove a little
sorrel horse in a light rig with one wheel dished, which made a crooked
track, and his disposition was something like the track of his buggy.
Following him at this place was Dr. Ellis, who went to that place from
Paris.

At Central City after Dr. Patterson came Mitchell, a state of Maine
Yankee. At an early date a majority of the people here abouts were from
the state of Maine, henceforth the name of Maine township. The Jordans,
Friesons, Clarks, Waterhouses, were early settlers from the state of
Maine.

Dr. Mitchell was a good doctor and a fine man. Poor fellow, he lost his
life by having administered to him by a mistake a teaspoonful of poison
when he was to have a tonic.

After his death at Central City the place was filled by Drs. Ristine,
Fisher, McTavish, my son, Dwight Sigworth, and Percy, a scientific
fellow. This field is now filled by Drs. Fisher and Woodbridge.

Waubeek was in the field of Dr. Love, he going northwest to Nugent's
Grove at times. Dear old Dr. Love was a splendid man, a first-class
diagnostician and a good physician and surgeon. If he lacked anything
it was aggressiveness in surgery.

While at Waubeek I had for co-laborers Drs. Phipps, Scott, Bowers, and
Grimm. Bowers tried to commit suicide by taking a teaspoonful of poison
which made him very sick, but he ultimately recovered. Dr. Grimm was
known as the Dutch doctor.

While I was at Waubeek when the river was high I had a stable on the
north side of the river and I used to cross in a skiff to feed my horse
and attend to calls on that side.

The north side of the river was all woods for three miles in those
days, and my practice was largely on that side. I used to go into
Delaware county, and I had a large slice of Jones county. And may I say
it, there are some families in that county which have had no doctor but
a Sigworth for forty-four years. After fourteen years I sold to Dr.
Crawford and then in four years he sold to Dr. Woodbridge, who in ten
years moved to Central City. At the present time Dr. Ward is in
Waubeek.

The practice in those days was fraught with a great deal of difficulty
and inconvenience. Swimming the river on horseback was one of the
experiences which I did not like. Many times have I been wet while
fording the streams with my feet on the dashboard of the buggy, my
attention being taken in guiding my horse to an opening in the timber
or a safe place to land.

Those were the days in which we drank brandy mixed with sorghum, which
was browned in the oven. This served the place of coffee. Grape-nuts, I
think, originated from this.

Of all of the forty-two doctors whom I have mentioned in this article I
have met thirty-five, and at the present time there are six doctors on
this field.


THE OLD MILL OF CENTRAL CITY

One of the land marks of the county is the old grist mill on the banks
of the Wapsie at Central City. For a history of this mill, as well as
for other interesting matter relative to the neighborhood, we are
indebted to E. S. Wetherbee, editor of the Central City _News-Letter_,
which paper in its issue of May 2, 1907, contained the following sketch
and reminiscence:

     There are in the history of every city or hamlet many
     incidents of early times which are interesting to the
     present day generation, and are often worth recording,
     otherwise they are apt to pass into entire oblivion. But few
     remain of the early settlers of this community to tell the
     story of those early days. Although not one of the first,
     yet being among the very oldest of those yet alive and
     living here is Mr. James Outing, and it is to him we credit
     the data of the contents of this article. [Mr. Outing died
     about a year after this interview.]

     Among the very first people to settle here may be named
     Chandler Jordan, who still lives on his farm southeast of
     town, old "Uncle Joe" Clark, who came in 1839, and other
     families by the names of Heubner, Crawley, Pond, Tisdell,
     and others who might be named who appeared here about the
     same time. For a number of years the only way of getting
     across the river, and that only when the water was low, was
     by fording it somewhere near what is now known as the upper
     bridge. From this the place received its first name, and
     whatever honor was attached to it was given Mr. Clark by
     calling it Clark's Ford.

     At that time Mr. Clark owned quite a large tract of land
     here, comprising all the land now inside the corporation
     west of Fourth street, the eighty acres lying east of Fourth
     street being owned by some land concern in Cascade. As did
     all his neighbors, Mr. Clark farmed in those days entirely
     with oxen.

     The place went by the name of Clark's Ford but a few years,
     however, for Mr. Clark and a few others conceived the idea
     of laying out a town, and the Cascade men came over and
     together they laid off the plat, and it was then decided to
     call it Central City.

     One of the first needs of the people of the little
     neighborhood was a more convenient way of crossing the
     Wapsie, and this meant that a bridge must be constructed.
     Accordingly one was built at the place where the north or
     upper bridge now crosses the river. It was not what in this
     day would be called an expensive structure or so very
     handsome when completed, but it represented much hard work,
     privations, and expense to those interested in the building
     of it. The county had but little to do with it, if any, the
     whole thing being done by popular subscription, and in those
     times, there not being many to subscribe, the task was
     indeed a big one for the little handful of people. There was
     some money raised, but more gave in work, others furnished
     lumber, a stick of timber, and so on, until finally it was
     completed and traffic over it was begun in 1857. This bridge
     did not stand the test long. In the summer of 1859 there
     came a big freshet and the bridge went down stream. With its
     going out occurred an incident, which, though possibly
     forgotten by others, yet still remains fresh in the memory
     of Chandler Jordan. He was on this side of the river and
     while the bridge swayed and was considered unsafe he
     concluded to risk it as he was anxious to get home. He was
     on horseback and over he started. When about half way across
     the bridge began breaking loose, and realizing his danger
     Mr. Jordan jumped off his horse and started on the run for
     the shore. The horse also made an extra effort to find solid
     footing and both succeeded in getting on the opposite bank
     just as the bridge swung out into midstream and started
     floating down the river. It was soon replaced by another
     wooden structure built by the county and costing about
     $4,000. This stood for many years but has long since passed
     away and been replaced by the steel bridge now spanning the
     river on the same site.

     But we started out to write about the old mill. It still
     stands, and with the exception of the necessary repairs
     which from time to time have been made, contains the same
     timbers and lumber it did when built. In the early fifties
     there came to this neighborhood two men, one by the name of
     St. John, the other by the name of John Peet, both men of
     push and ambition. Realizing the tremendous power to be
     obtained from the waters of the Wapsie, and the ease with
     which a dam could be constructed where it now is, with the
     rocky banks on either side, and knowing the great demand for
     lumber, in the then fast settling community, they begun the
     construction of a dam with the intention of running a saw
     mill with it. The work on the dam was begun in 1855 by the
     two men mentioned, but was not finished until the next year,
     the work being engineered by old Mr. Bowdish, father of I.
     P. Bowdish. It was finished in 1856, as was also the old saw
     mill which stood for many years on the south bank of the
     river and did a flourishing business. Like many other old
     land marks it is gone. But many a stick of timber and lots
     of the old oak boards sawed there may yet be found in the
     older buildings about town.

     The country all about here was fast settling up, and one of
     the principal crops was wheat. It was a long way to market,
     the nearest railroad station being at Marion. St. John and
     Peet concluded that a flouring mill would be a paying
     enterprise, and began the erection of the mill. The lumber
     was sawed at the sawmill, and the heavy timbers, of which
     there were many, mostly came from a forty on what now
     belongs to the Gus Hatch farm north of town.

     Mentioning these timbers calls to the mind of Mr. Outing an
     incident which he threw into this narrative. There was a
     character who lived here by the name of Henry Hutchins. He
     was fond of hunting and fishing and would be gone often for
     a period of several days, no one knowing of his whereabouts.
     About this time he disappeared, and his absence became so
     protracted that his many friends began to fear that
     something had happened to him. It was while a party of
     choppers was hunting for timbers for the mill on the forty
     mentioned that one day they found Hutchins' lifeless body
     and beside it lay his gun with every indication that he had
     committed suicide.

     When the timbers were all on the ground, hewed and framed,
     everybody for miles around was invited and came to help with
     the raising. It was a mammoth job and occupied the better
     part of a week. Mr. Outing was there from start to finish.
     The mill was completed and began operations in 1859. St.
     John and Peet ran it for only about three years when they
     sold it to E. R. Burns, who ran it until 1867, when it
     passed into the hands of Hatch & Co., they paying for it the
     sum of $16,000. They conducted it for five years when it
     again passed into the hands of Mr. Burns who owned and
     operated it until sometime in the latter eighties. Since
     then it has changed hands several times, but the valuation
     for many years has not been one-fourth of what it originally
     was. For a great many years it did a big business grinding
     thousands and thousands of bushels of wheat each season, the
     flour being hauled across the country to Marion by teams. As
     the raising of wheat played out so the value and popularity
     of the mill depreciated until finally, as now, it was used
     only as a grist mill. The building is now owned by parties
     in the east and is being run by T. J. Liddington who runs it
     and any day may be found there taking care of any demands
     made upon him. He works alone, surrounded by a vast amount
     of empty space that was once filled with piles of grain,
     machinery, and the several men required to look after the
     big business.[O]

The history of the settlements in Linn county has been a history of
struggle, of privation and of endurance. It was not an easy matter to
have to go to Muscatine or Dubuque to mill and market; to travel by
night on horseback some fifty miles for a doctor, and equally far to
find a drug store. There were no roads passable for a greater part of
the year; the rivers were not bridged, and the streams oftentimes were
swollen so that the only means of crossing was by swimming or by making
some temporary raft. The pioneer settler who wandered out over the
prairie in a winter blizzard no doubt many times looked for the "smoke
that so gracefully curls above the green elms" to indicate that a cabin
was near.

The new settlers found Iowa as they had so often heard of it as "a
wilderness of prairie land." It was well watered, and along the streams
could be found enough timber to erect fences and furnish fuel and
rails. They generally located in the edge of the timber and along the
streams, and hesitated about locating on the prairie till much later.
There they found richer land than along the timber. These first
settlers came from the far east and south, Ohio, Indiana, New York,
Virginia, South Carolina, and the New England states. They came from
Maryland, from Kentucky, and Tennessee. Some walked, like Ellis and
Crow. Still others came in canvas covered wagons, in which the family
were housed. They brought enough utensils to cook their scanty meals.
The wagon was drawn by horses or oxen, followed by a few cows, an extra
horse or two, and several dogs. At night they would camp by the side of
some stream or near an oak tree.

Not till the fifties and sixties did the foreigners arrive in any large
numbers. As soon as they had been here a short time they wrote home
their first impressions, and from that time a steady stream of foreign
immigration poured into Iowa. These early pioneers waited long for
railroads, for steamboats, and for good roads. Their produce was cheap
and money was scarce, while interest was high. But they held on to
their claims, ever looking for the brighter day. They possessed
courage, hope, and the ability to wait and struggle till the times
would change for the better. While many of the first settlers did not
live to see their plans realized, later descendants sing their praises
and embalm the memories of those who made the county, the cities, and
the towns what they are today.

Truly it can be said of the settlers of Linn county that they were a
sturdy class of men and women, of whom their descendants may be justly
proud. And the old pioneers who remain--when they reflect on the past
and recall the days of old lang syne--cannot refrain from shedding
affectionate tears for those who have gone hence. They call to mind the
lines of the poet:

     "Two dreams came down to earth one night
       From the realms of mist and dew,
     One was a dream of the old, old days,
       And one was a dream of the new."

Pioneer days in Linn county were days of hardships, often of exposure,
but their trials only served to develop the manhood and womanhood of
the early settlers who never thought of returning, whose "only aim was
to wait and see."

Certainly Kipling's lines apply to conditions as they existed in Linn
county in pioneer days:

     "To the far flung fenceless prairie
     Where the quick cloud shadows trail,
     To the barn in the neighbor's offing,
     To the land of the new cut rail,
     To the plough in the league long furrow,
     To the gray lake gulls behind,
     To the weight of half a year's winter,
     To the warm, wet western wind."

by steamers to Muscatine. Col. Robt. Smyth was one of those who thus

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
